## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Player Analysis

```python
from nhl_api_client import NHLAPIClient

client = NHLAPIClient()

# Analyze Connor McDavid's 2023-24 season
mcdavid_id = 8478402
season = "20232024"

# Get comprehensive stats
stats = client.get_comprehensive_player_stats(mcdavid_id, season)

print(f"Goals: {stats['summary']['goals']}")
print(f"Assists: {stats['summary']['assists']}")
print(f"Points: {stats['summary']['points']}")
print(f"Hits: {stats['realtime']['hits']}")
print(f"Power Play Goals: {stats['powerplay']['powerPlayGoals']}")
```

### Example 2: Team Comparison

```python
# Compare team power play effectiveness
pp_stats = client.get_team_powerplay_stats("20232024")

# Sort by power play percentage
pp_stats_sorted = pp_stats.sort_values('powerPlayPct', ascending=False)

print("Top 5 Power Play Teams:")
print(pp_stats_sorted[['teamFullName', 'powerPlayPct', 'powerPlayGoals']].head())
```

### Example 3: Export Data

```python
# Export comprehensive player data to Excel
import pandas as pd

# Get various stats
summary = client.get_skater_stats_by_season("20232024", limit=500)
realtime = client.get_skater_realtime_stats("20232024", limit=500)
powerplay = client.get_skater_powerplay_stats("20232024", limit=500)

# Create Excel file with multiple sheets
with pd.ExcelWriter('nhl_stats_2023-24.xlsx') as writer:
    summary.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Summary', index=False)
    realtime.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='RealTime', index=False)
    powerplay.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='PowerPlay', index=False)
```

### Example 4: Schedule Analysis

```python
# Analyze today's games
schedule = client.get_schedule_now()

if schedule and 'gameWeek' in schedule:
    for day in schedule['gameWeek']:
        if day.get('games'):
            for game in day['games']:
                away = game['awayTeam']['placeName']['default']
                home = game['homeTeam']['placeName']['default']
                print(f"{away} @ {home}")
```

## Season ID Format

Season IDs follow the format `YYYYYYYY` where the first four digits are the start year and the last four are the end year:

- `20232024` = 2023-24 season
- `20222023` = 2022-23 season
- `20212022` = 2021-22 season

## Player ID

Player IDs are unique NHL identifiers. You can find them:

1. From the NHL website URLs
2. Using the roster endpoints
3. From existing data exports

Example: Connor McDavid's ID is `8478402`

## Error Handling

The client includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    stats = client.get_player_season_stats(player_id, season_id)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving stats: {e}")
```

## Rate Limiting

The client respects NHL API rate limits. If you're making many requests, consider:

- Adding delays between requests
- Using bulk endpoints when available
- Caching frequently accessed data
