    "title": "Duello - Virial Coefficient and Dissociation Constant Estimation for Rigid Macromolecules",
    "description": "Duello is a tool to evaluate the two-body partition function between rigid bodies, performing a statistical mechanical average over inter-molecular orientations using subdivided icosahedrons. The osmotic second virial coefficient; binary dissociation constant; and the potential of mean force is calculated.",
