**Wetlands** is a lightweight Python library for managing **Conda** environments.

**Wetlands** can create Conda environments on demand, install dependencies, and execute arbitrary code within them. This makes it easy to build *plugin systems* or integrate external modules into an application without dependency conflicts, as each environment remains isolated.

The name ***Wetlands*** comes from the tropical *environments* where anacondas thrive.

**Source Code:** https://github.com/arthursw/wetlands/

## âœ¨ Features

- **Automatic Environment Management**: Create and configure environments on demand.
- **Dependency Isolation**: Install dependencies without conflicts.
- **Embedded Execution**: Run Python functions inside isolated environments.
- **Micromamba**: Wetlands uses a self-contained `micromamba` for fast and lightweight Conda environment handling.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install **Wetlands**, simply use `pip`:

```sh
pip install wetlands
```

## ðŸš€ Usage Example

If the user doesn't have pixi or micromamba installed, Wetlands will download and set it up automatically.

```python

from wetlands.environment_manager import EnvironmentManager

# Initialize the environment manager
# Wetlands will use the existing Pixi or Micromamba installation at the specified path (e.g., "pixi/" or "micromamba/") if available;
# otherwise it will automatically download and install Pixi or Micromamba in a self-contained manner.
environmentManager = EnvironmentManager("pixi/")

# Create and launch an isolated Conda environment named "numpy"
env = environmentManager.create("numpy", {"pip":["numpy==2.2.4"]})
env.launch()

# Import example_module in the environment, see example_module.py below
minimal_module = env.importModule("minimal_module.py")
# example_module is a proxy to example_module.py in the environment
array = [1,2,3]
result = minimal_module.sum(array)

print(f"Sum of {array} is {result}.")

# Clean up and exit the environment
env.exit()

```

with `example_module.py` as follow:

```python
def sum(x):
    import numpy as np
    return int(np.sum(x))
```

See the `examples/` folder for more detailed examples.

## ðŸ¤– Development

Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to easily manage the project.

### Check & Format

Check for code errors with `uv run ruff check` and format the code with `uv run ruff format`.

### Tests

Test wetlands with `uv` and `ipdb`: `uv run pytest --pdb --pdbcls=IPython.terminal.debugger:TerminalPdb tests`
Use `--last-failed` to only re-run the failures: `uv run pytest --pdb --pdbcls=IPython.terminal.debugger:TerminalPdb --last-failed tests`

### Build and Publish

Build with `uv build`
Publish with `uv publish dist/wetlands-VERSION_NAME*`

### Generate documentation

The Wetlands documentation is generated with [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/), [`mike`](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) and others.

Install the doc tools with `uv pip install  ".[docs]"`.

MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. Start it with: `uv run mkdocs serve`.

[`mike`](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) is used to generate multiple versions of the docs. To create a new version, `mike deploy [version]` is used by Github Actions, just update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The doc is automatically generated by [Github Actions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions-material-for-mkdocs) (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

The script `scripts/gen_ref_pages.py` is used  by mkdocs to generate the API reference automatically (see [mkdocstrings recipes](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/recipes/)).

## ðŸ“‹ Todo

- Handle general [dependency specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#dependency-specifiers) (handle version specifiers like '>=', '~=' etc.).
- Use Pixi features and environment instead of creating one workspace per environment.
- Accept `environment.yml` files for environment creation.
- Enable to change the logs paths.
- Update doc for windows
