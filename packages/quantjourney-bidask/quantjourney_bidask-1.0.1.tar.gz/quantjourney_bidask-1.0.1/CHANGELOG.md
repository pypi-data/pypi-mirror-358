  - `edge_rolling()`: Rolling window spread estimates with vectorized operations
  - `edge_expanding()`: Expanding window spread estimates
- Data fetching capabilities:
  - `fetch_yfinance_data()`: Yahoo Finance integration via yfinance
  - `fetch_binance_data()`: Binance API integration via custom FastAPI server
- Real-time monitoring:
  - `LiveSpreadMonitor`: WebSocket-based real-time spread monitoring
  - Configurable alert thresholds and callbacks
  - Multi-symbol support for cryptocurrency pairs
- Comprehensive examples:
  - Basic spread estimation with synthetic and real data
  - Animated spread monitoring for presentations
  - Multi-cryptocurrency spread comparison analysis
  - Liquidity risk monitoring with statistical alerts
  - Real-time WebSocket implementation examples
- Professional documentation:
  - Detailed docstrings following NumPy style
  - Academic paper validation (matches expected results)
  - Usage examples with both synthetic and real market data
- Testing framework:
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Validation against original research paper results
  - Edge case handling (missing data, insufficient observations)

### Technical Details
- Implements the methodology from "Efficient estimation of bidâ€“ask spreads from open, high, low, and close prices" (Journal of Financial Economics, 2024)
- Vectorized operations for high-performance rolling calculations
- Proper handling of missing values and edge cases
- Support for multiple data frequencies (minute, hourly, daily)
- WebSocket integration for real-time cryptocurrency data
- Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml

### Dependencies
- numpy >= 1.20
- pandas >= 1.5
