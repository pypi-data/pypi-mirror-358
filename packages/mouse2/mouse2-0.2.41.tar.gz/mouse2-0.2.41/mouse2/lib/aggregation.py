    This function returns a data structure containing list of aggregates
    for all of the timesteps in the MDAnalysis universe.
    Each aggregate is determined as a complete graph of neighbors.
    The atoms are considered neighbors if the distance between their
    centers does not exceed r_neigh.
    Each aggregate is represented as a list of MDAnalysis atom indices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    universe : mda.Universe
        MDAnalysis universe. Only the bonds required for calculation of the
        ordering parameter shall be present. All other bonds shall be deleted
        from the universe before the analysis.
    r_max : FLOAT, optional
        Maximum distance at which the atoms are considered neighbors.
    selection : STR, optional
        Selection string for MDAnalysis select_atoms command.
        Only the selected atoms will be considered.
        The default is None, and all atoms are taken into account.

    Returns
