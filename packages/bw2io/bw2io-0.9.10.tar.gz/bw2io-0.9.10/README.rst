This package provides tools for the import, export, and management of inventory databases and impact assessment methods. It is part of the `Brightway LCA framework <https://brightway.dev/>`_. `Online documentation <https://2.docs.brightway.dev/>`_ is available, and the source code is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-io>`_.

Bw2io approach
---------------

brightway2-io is an ETL library. First, data is *extracted* into a common format. Next, a series of *strategies* is employed to uniquely identify each dataset and link datasets internally and to the biosphere. Following internal linking, linking to other background datasets can be performed. Finally, database data is written to disk.

This approach offers a number of benefits that help mitigate some of the serious problems in existing inventory data formats: the number of unlinked exchanges can be easily seen, linking strategies can be iteratively applied, and intermediate results can be saved.

Here is a typical usage. Note that we also have shortcuts for popular LCA databases such as ecoinvent:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [1]: import bw2io as bi

Note that brightway2-io can't magically make problems in databases go away.
