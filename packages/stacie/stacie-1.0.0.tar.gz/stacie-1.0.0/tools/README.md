# Tools for development and testing

This directory contains simple scripts designed to
facilitate the development and testing of **STACIE**.

- `gensynth.py`: Generates synthetic data, saves the results,
and creates plots of the spectrum based on the generated data.
This is useful for testing and visualizing synthetic datasets.
- `quick.py`:  Provides a simple and minimal example of using **STACIE**,
showcasing its outputs and plots for quick testing and demonstration purposes.
