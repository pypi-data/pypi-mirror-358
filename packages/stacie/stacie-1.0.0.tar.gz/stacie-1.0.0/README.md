STACIE stands for the *STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator*.
It is a Python package for post-processing molecular dynamics simulations,
but it can also be used for more general analysis of time-correlated data.
Typical applications include estimating transport properties,
uncertainties of averages over time-correlated data,
and analysis of characteristic timescales.

All information about STACIE can be found in the [Documentation](https://molmod.github.io/stacie).
