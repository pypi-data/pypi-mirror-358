A novel neural network architecture that extends Mixture of Experts (MoE) with hierarchical expert clustering, dynamic tree-based routing, and advanced reliability tracking for improved scalability, specialization, and robustness.

## Abstract

ClusterMoE introduces a hierarchical organization of experts within the Mixture of Experts framework, addressing key limitations in scalability, expert utilization, and routing efficiency. The architecture employs a two-level routing mechanism that first selects relevant expert clusters, then routes tokens to specific experts within those clusters. This hierarchical approach reduces routing complexity from O(N) to O(log N) while maintaining the benefits of expert specialization.

## Key Contributions

- **Hierarchical Expert Clustering**: Organizes experts into specialized clusters for improved task specialization and reduced routing complexity
- **Dynamic Tree-Based Routing**: Implements intelligent routing through cluster and expert hierarchies with reliability-aware decision making
- **Reliability-Aware Routing**: Routes tokens based on expert and cluster reliability scores derived from performance metrics
- **Advanced Load Balancing**: Multi-level load balancing with capacity constraints and dynamic weight adjustment
- **Expert Specialization Tracking**: Monitors and encourages expert specialization through diversity loss functions
- **Adaptive Routing Weights**: Dynamic adjustment of routing decisions based on historical performance and reliability metrics

## Architecture Overview

ClusterMoE introduces a hierarchical structure that organizes experts into clusters, enabling more sophisticated routing decisions and better resource utilization:

### Theoretical Performance Benefits

#### 1. Enhanced Scalability
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Reduces routing complexity from O(N) to O(log N) where N is total experts
- **Cluster-Level Pruning**: Early elimination of irrelevant clusters reduces computational overhead
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent cluster processing enables better parallelization and resource utilization

#### 2. Improved Specialization
- **Expert Clustering**: Similar experts are grouped together, enabling better specialization and knowledge sharing
- **Task-Specific Routing**: Different clusters can specialize in different types of tasks or domains
- **Diversity Encouragement**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent expert collapse and maintain diversity

#### 3. Better Reliability
- **Reliability Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of expert and cluster performance through exponential moving averages
- **Adaptive Routing**: Routing decisions adapt based on historical performance and reliability metrics
- **Fault Tolerance**: Degraded experts are automatically deprioritized through reliability-based weighting

#### 4. Advanced Load Balancing
- **Multi-Level Balancing**: Load balancing at both cluster and expert levels with capacity constraints
- **Capacity Constraints**: Prevents over-utilization of individual experts through dynamic capacity management
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time adjustment of routing weights based on utilization patterns
