This document deals with how to print the builder name when presenting it to users.

- We don't want the users to specify a name for each builder for many reasons:
    - there may be a great many number of builders.
    - it's yet another chore for the users which I don't think is necessary.
    - I think there is a way to generate a name which is rather short and good
        automatically (read below).

So what should we use as a builder name?

Here is an Idea:
    Mako(inputs=['templates/README.rst.mako'], outputs=['README.rst'])

What is the outputs are unknown?
    Mako(inputs=['templates/README.rst.mako'], outputs=Unknown)
    We can print the outputs after the run.

The implication of this is that all builders need to have a standard way
	to show their inputs and outputs.
	This should be in their parent.
