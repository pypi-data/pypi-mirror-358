""" diagram.py

Injest a pyrarchical-state-machine and draw diagrams of it with plant UML.

This code shamelessly borrowed from https://github.com/MainspringEnergy/eta-hsm

I originally thought that the functionality to spit out plant UML code would just be build directly
into hsm.py, but to keep that code lightweight, I am going to start off with using this as an external
translation module.

        """Generate plant uml for state.

        Generate the text input expected by PlantUML for automatically drawing a UML state diagram

        `top` specifies the top of **this** diagram, effectively defining the scope.

        Transitions to states outside of this scope will be directed to UML's "final" state.

        Transitions from states outside of this scope are (for now) simply omitted.

        This functionality original resided within the State class, but I was having to pass in a reference
        to the state machine in order to look up "scope" of target states, so I decided to move it here to the
        StateMachine class.  The downside is that now I had to make more of the details of the State class public.
