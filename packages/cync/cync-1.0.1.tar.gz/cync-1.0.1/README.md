# Cync

> A blazing-fast, I/O-efficient Python tool for local file synchronization.

**Cync** is a fast and efficient local file synchronization tool.  
It detects and syncs changes with minimal disk I/O, making updates faster and more resource-friendly.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Metadata-based comparison**  
  Compares file size and modification timestamps before falling back to byte-level comparison.

- **Reduced disk I/O**  
  Skips files that haven't changed to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.

- **Partial file copying**  
  Only modified byte ranges are transferred, not entire files.

- **Include/Exclude filters**  
  rsync-style filtering with `--include` and `--exclude` options.

---

## 📦 Installation

You can install **Cync** via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cync/) using pip:

```bash
pip install cync
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and run it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZacharyShonk/Cync.git
cd Cync
python3 main.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
python3 -m cync /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

or if running from the cloned repo:

```bash
python3 main.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

- `/path/to/source`: The directory you want to sync from.
- `/path/to/destination`: The target directory to sync to.

Optional arguments:

- `--include PATTERN`: Include files or directories matching this pattern (can be repeated).
- `--exclude PATTERN`: Exclude files or directories matching this pattern (can be repeated).
