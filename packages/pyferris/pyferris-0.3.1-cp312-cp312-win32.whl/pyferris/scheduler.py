class WorkStealingScheduler:
    """
    A work-stealing scheduler for dynamic load balancing.
    
    Work-stealing is optimal for workloads with variable execution times.
    When a worker finishes its tasks, it can "steal" work from other workers
    that are still busy, ensuring optimal CPU utilization.
    
    Args:
        workers (int): Number of worker threads to use.
    
    Example:
        >>> scheduler = WorkStealingScheduler(workers=4)
        >>> 
        >>> def variable_work(x):
        ...     # Some tasks take longer than others
