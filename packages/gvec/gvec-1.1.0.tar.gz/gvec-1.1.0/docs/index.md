# The Galerkin Variational Equilibrium Code
## A flexible 3D MHD equilibrium solver
</div>

[GVEC](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/gvec-group/gvec) is an open-source software for the generation of three-dimensional ideal MHD equilibria.

:::{grid-item-card} Inspired by VMEC
Ideas are strongly based on [VMEC](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/STELLOPT/VMEC) (Hirshman & Whitson, 1983).
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Python bindings
Installable with `pip`. Python bindings for running, postprocessing and integration with other tools.
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Radial B-Splines
Radial discretization using B-Splines of arbitrary polynomial degree. Fourier series in poloidal and toroidal direction with different maximum modenumber for each variable.
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Multiple Interfaces
Initialize with a VMEC netCDF output or interface with other codes: JOREK, CASTOR3D, GENE...
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Flexible Mapping
Choice of the mapping $(X^1,X^2,\zeta) \mapsto (x,y,z)$, not restricted to $(R,Z,\phi)$, but e.g. a [generalized Frenet frame](#g-frame).
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Modern Fortran
Use of modern object-oriented Fortran
