CodeEnigma is a Python package for lightweight code obfuscation using AES-256 encryption and Base64 encoding. It helps protect your Python code from exposing raw source code while distributing.

## üîí Why CodeEnigma?
After searching extensively for a free and open-source Python obfuscation tool, I realized that most available options were either paid, closed-source, or opaque in how they worked. I wasn't comfortable letting a black-box tool encrypt my production code without knowing exactly what it was doing ‚Äî especially when it had access to sensitive logic.

So I built **CodeEnigma** ‚Äî a transparent, self-contained solution that gives you full control over the obfuscation process, with no hidden logic and no external servers involved. 

This project is inspired by [PyArmor](https://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/) but with a different approach.

## High Level Architecture

![Image](static/CodeEnigma.HLD.svg)

The working principle of CodeEnigma is simple:
1. The user provides the path to the Python module to obfuscate.
2. CodeEnigma reads the module's source code.
3. An AES-256 key is generated using a secure random number generator and set in `private.py`
4. Obfuscation runs file by file running the following steps:
   * 4.1. Compile using `compile(code, str(file_path), "exec")` 
   * 4.2. Compress the byte code using `zlib.compress(compiled_code)`
   * 4.3. Encode the compressed byte code using `base64.b64encode(compressed_code)`
   * 4.4. Encrypt the encoded byte code using `AESGCM(SECRET_KEY).encrypt(NONCE, obfuscated, associated_data=None)`
   _[refer for more details](codeenigma/core.py)_:
5. CodeEnigma creates a new module with the obfuscated code.
6. A codeenigma_runtime.pyx file is created with the deobfuscation logic to decrypt and execute the obfuscated code.
7. The runtime is compiled to a Python extension module using Cython. Also generates a codeenigma_runtime.whl file for distribution.
8. End of process, the obfuscated module is ready to be distributed as wheel files.

## Features

- üîí Strong encryption using AES-256
- üîÑ Simple API for obfuscating any python module
- üîë Secure and dynamic key generation
- üõ†Ô∏è Command-line interface for easy integration into build processes
- üì¶ Lightweight and dependency-minimal

## Installation

Using Poetry:

```bash
poetry add codeenigma
```

Using pip:

```bash
pip install codeenigma
```

## Usage

CodeEnigma comes with a user-friendly command-line interface powered by Typer. The CLI provides helpful prompts and rich output.

### Basic Usage

To obfuscate a Python module:

```bash
codeenigma obfuscate /path/to/your/module
```

### Command Line Options

- `--expiration`, `-e`: Set an expiration date for the obfuscated code (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--output`, `-o`, `--dist`: Specify output directory (default: 'dist')
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Show detailed output

#### Examples

Obfuscate with an expiration date:

> _The following example will obfuscate the module and set the expiration date to December 31, 2025, at 23:59:59+0530 (IST)._
```bash
codeenigma obfuscate /path/to/your/module -e "2025-12-31 23:59:59+0530"
```

Specify custom output directory:
```bash
codeenigma obfuscate /path/to/your/module -o custom_output
```

### Version Information

To check the installed version:
```bash
codeenigma version
```
