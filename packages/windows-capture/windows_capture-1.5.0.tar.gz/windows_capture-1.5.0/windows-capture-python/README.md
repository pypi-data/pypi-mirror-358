```

## Usage

```python
from windows_capture import WindowsCapture, Frame, InternalCaptureControl

# Every Error From on_closed and on_frame_arrived Will End Up Here
capture = WindowsCapture(
    cursor_capture=None,
    draw_border=None,
    monitor_index=None,
    window_name=None,
)


# Called Every Time A New Frame Is Available
@capture.event
def on_frame_arrived(frame: Frame, capture_control: InternalCaptureControl):
    print("New Frame Arrived")

    # Save The Frame As An Image To The Specified Path
    frame.save_as_image("image.png")

    # Gracefully Stop The Capture Thread
    capture_control.stop()


# Called When The Capture Item Closes Usually When The Window Closes, Capture
# Session Will End After This Function Ends
@capture.event
def on_closed():
    print("Capture Session Closed")


capture.start()
```
