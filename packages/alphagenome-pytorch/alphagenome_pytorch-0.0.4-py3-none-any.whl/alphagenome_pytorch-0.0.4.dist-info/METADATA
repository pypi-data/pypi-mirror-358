## AlphaGenome (wip)

Implementation of [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/), Deepmind's updated genomic attention model

## Install

```bash
$ pip install alphagenome-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from alphagenome_pytorch import TransformerTower

transformer = TransformerTower(dim = 768, dim_pairwise = 128)

single = torch.randn(2, 512, 768)

attended_single, attended_pairwise = transformer(single)
```
