## AlphaGenome (wip)

Implementation of [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/), Deepmind's updated genomic attention model

## Install

```bash
$ pip install alphagenome-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from alphagenome_pytorch import AlphaGenome

model = AlphaGenome()

dna = torch.randint(0, 5, (2, 8192))

pred_nucleotide, single, pairwise = model(dna) # (2, 8192, 5), (2, 64, 1536), (2, 4, 4, 1536)
```
