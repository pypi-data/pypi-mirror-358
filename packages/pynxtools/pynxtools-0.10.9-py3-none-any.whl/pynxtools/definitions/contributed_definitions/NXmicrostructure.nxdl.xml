        Base class to describe a microstructure, its structural aspects, associated descriptors, properties.
        
        Whether one uses a continuum or atomic scale description of materials, these are always a model only of
        the true internal structure of a material. Such models are useful as they enable a coarse-graining and
        categorizing of properties and representational aspects from which measured or simulated descriptions
        can be correlated with properties, i.e. descriptor values.
        
        Keep in mind that most specimens are thermo-chemo-mechanically processed prior characterization.
        Therefore, the characterized microstructure may not have probed the same structure as of the untreated
        sample from which the region-of-interests on the specimen were sampled.
        
        Fields such as time and increment enable a quantification of the spatiotemporal evolution of a materials'
        structure by using multiple instances of NXmicrostructure. Both measurements and simulation virtually
        always sample this evolution. Most microscopy techniques support to generate only a two-dimensional
        representation (projection) of the characterized material. Often materials are characterized only for
        specific states or via sampling coarsely in time relative to the timescale at which the
        physical phenomena take place. This is typically a compromise between the research questions at hand and technical surplus practical limitations.
        
        The term microstructural feature covers here crystals and all sorts of crystal defects within the material.
        A key challenge with the description of representations and properties of microstructural features is that
        features with different dimensionality exist and combinations of features of different dimensionality are
        frequently expected to be documented with intuitive naming conventions using flat property lists.
        For these key-value dictionaries often folksonomies are used. These can be based on ad hoc documentation
        of such dictionaries in the literature and the metadata section of public data repositories.
        
        NXmicrostructure is an attempt to standardize these descriptions stronger.
        
        The descriptive variety is large especially for junctions. Like crystals and interfaces, junctions are features in
        three-dimensional Euclidean space even if they are formed maybe only through a monolayer or pearl chain of atoms.
        Either way the local atomic and electronic environment is different compared to the situation of an ideal crystal,
        which gives typically rise to a plethora of configurations of which some yield useful properties.
        
        Like crystals and interfaces, junctions are assumed to represent groups of atoms that have specific descriptor values
        which are different to other features. Taking an example, a triple junction is practically a three-dimensional defect as its atoms
        are arranged in three-dimensional space but the characteristics of that defect can often be reduced to a lower-dimensional
        description such as a triple point or a triple line. Therefore, different representations can be used to describe the location,
        shape, and structure of the defect. As different types of crystal defects can interact, there is a substantial number of
        in principle characterizable and representable objects. Take again a triple line as an example. It is a tubular feature built from three
        adjoining interfaces. However, dislocations as line defects can interact with triple lines. Therefore, one can also argue that
        along a triple line there can be dislocation-line-triple-line junctions, likewise dislocations form own junctions.
        
        It is not the aim of this base class to cover all these cases, rather this base class currently provides examples how the
        typically most relevant types of features can be represented using a combination of base classes in NeXus. Currently,
        these are crystals, interfaces, triple lines, quadruple junctions.
        
        The description attempt here took inspiration from `E. E. Underwood &lt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.1972.tb03709.x&gt;`_
        and E. E. Underwood's book on Quantitative Stereology published 1970 to categorize features based on their dimensionality.
        
        Identifiers can be defined either implicitly or explicitly. Identifiers for implicit indexing are defined
        on the interval :math:`[identifier\_offset, identifier\_offset + cardinality - 1]`.

            An example for a volume bounded by other crystal defects. Crystals can be grains of
            different phases, precipitates, dispersoids; there are many terms used specifically in
            the materials engineering community.
            
            Typically, crystals are measured on the surface of a sample via optical or electron microscopy.
            Using X-ray diffraction methods crystals can be observed in bulk specimens.
            
            Crystals are represented by a set of pixel, voxel, or polygons and their polyline boundaries.
            In rare cases the volume bounded gets represented using constructive solid geometry approaches.
