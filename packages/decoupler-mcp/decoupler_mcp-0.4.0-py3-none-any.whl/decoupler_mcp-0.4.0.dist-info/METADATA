# decoupler-MCP

Natural language interface for scRNA-Seq analysis with decoupler through MCP.

## 🪩 What can it do?

- IO module like read and write scRNA-Seq data
- Pathway activity/Transcription factor  inference
- Tool module, like clustering, differential expression etc.
- Plotting module, like violin, umap/tsne

## ❓ Who is this for?

- Anyone who wants to do scRNA-Seq analysis natural language!
- Agent developers who want to call decoupler's functions for their applications

## 🌐 Where to use it?

You can use decoupler-mcp in most AI clients, plugins, or agent frameworks that support the MCP:

- AI clients, like Cherry Studio
- Plugins, like Cline
- Agent frameworks, like Agno 

## 🎬 Demo

A demo showing scRNA-Seq cell cluster analysis in a AI client Cherry Studio using natural language based on decoupler-mcp

## 🏎️ Quickstart

### Install

Install from PyPI
```
pip install decoupler-mcp
```
you can test it by running
```
decoupler-mcp run
```



#### run decoupler-mcp locally
Refer to the following configuration in your MCP client:

check path
```
$ which decoupler 
/home/test/bin/decoupler-mcp
```

```
"mcpServers": {
  "decoupler-mcp": {
    "command": "/home/test/bin/decoupler-mcp",
    "args": [
      "run"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### run decoupler-server remotely
Refer to the following configuration in your MCP client:

run it in your server
```
decoupler-mcp run --transport shttp --port 8000
```

Then configure your MCP client in local AI client, like this:
```

"mcpServers": {
  "decoupler-mcp": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
  }
}
```
