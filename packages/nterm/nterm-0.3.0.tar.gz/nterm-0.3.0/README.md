```

## Getting Started: Usage Examples and Tutorials

### Basic Command-Line Usage

**Start Interactive Session:**
```bash
nterm
```

**Execute Single Query:**
```bash
nterm --query "What operating system am I running and what are the current system specifications?"
```

**Use Specific AI Model:**
```bash
nterm --model gpt-4.1 --query "Analyze current CPU usage and suggest optimization strategies"
```

### Python API Integration Examples

**Basic Usage:**
```python
from nterm import ReasoningAgent

# Initialize the AI reasoning agent
agent = ReasoningAgent()

# Query system information
response = agent.query("What's the current memory usage and which processes are using the most RAM?")
print(response)

# Start interactive command-line mode
agent.run_cli()
```

**Advanced Configuration:**
```python
from nterm import create_nterm
from my_custom_tools import CustomSystemTool

# Create agent with custom settings
agent = create_nterm(
    model_id="gpt-4.1",
    db_file="./system_sessions.db",
    num_history_runs=10
)

# Add custom tools and extensions
agent.add_tool(CustomSystemTool())

# Retrieve conversation history
session_history = agent.get_session_history()

# Clear stored history
agent.clear_history()
```

## Configuration Options and Customization
