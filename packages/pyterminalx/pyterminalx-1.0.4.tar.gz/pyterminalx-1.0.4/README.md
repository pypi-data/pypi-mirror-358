## 🌟 Description

**pyterminal** is a powerful simulation of the Linux command-line environment that runs directly on Windows. It is specially designed for:

- **Students** who cannot install Linux due to lack of knowledge, limited storage, or fear of corrupting their system.
- **Developers** who want to build and test terminal-based tools with real command output.
- **Educators** who want to demonstrate Linux CLI without needing virtual machines or dual-boot setups.

You can run commands like `cp`, `mv`, `chmod`, `git`, `curl`, `bash`, `python`, and many more — just like in a real Linux environment — all within your current operating system.

- ✅ Implements core Unix file operations: `cp`, `mv`, `touch`, `ln`, `chmod`, `find`, etc.
- ✅ Includes advanced tools: `chown`, `chgrp`, `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, and `umask`
- ✅ Root and guest user roles simulation
- ✅ Python-based and fully customizable
- ✅ Educational and lightweight
