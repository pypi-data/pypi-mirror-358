The IBM i SQLAlchemy adapter provides an [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
interface to Db2 for [IBM i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i).

## Requirements

### SQLAlchemy

| SQLAlchemy Version | Supported | Notes                                           |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| SQLAlchemy 1.3     |    ✅     | Most tested.                                    |
| SQLAlchemy 1.4     |    ✅     | Preliminary support added in 0.9.3.             |
| SQLAlchemy 2.0+    |    ❌     | Currently not supported, but planned for 0.9.4. |

### Python

Python 3.7 - 3.11 are supported. Support for Python 3.12 and
up is [currently broken](https://github.com/IBM/sqlalchemy-ibmi/issues/149).

### IBM i Access ODBC Driver

It is best to use the latest version of the driver, which is currently available in the
IBM i Access Client Solutions Application Package 1.1.0.27.

Some options may require certain minimum driver versions to be enabled. Because the
driver ignores any unknown options, using them on older driver versions will not cause
an error but instead be silently ignored.

|  Connection Option | Required Version  |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `trim_char_fields` |    1.1.0.25       |

### IBM i

This adapter is only tested against IBM i 7.3 and up. It may support older IBM i
releases, but no support is guaranteed.

## Installation

```sh
pip install sqlalchemy-ibmi
```

## Getting Started

You will need to have the [IBM i Access ODBC Driver](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-client-solutions)
installed in order to use this adapter. Please read
[these docs](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/odbc/installation.html)
for the simplest way to install for your platform.

```python
import sqlalchemy as sa
engine = sa.create_engine("ibmi://user:password@host.example.com")

cnxn = engine.connect()
metadata = sa.MetaData()
table = sa.Table('table_name', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

query = sa.select([table])

result = cnxn.execute(query)
result = result.fetchall()

# print first entry
print(result[0])
```

For more details on connection options, check
[our docs](https://sqlalchemy-ibmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest#connection-arguments)

If you're new to SQLAlchemy, please refer to the
[SQLAlchemy Unified Tutorial](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/index.html).

## Documentation

The documentation for the SQLAlchemy adapter for IBM i can be found at:
<https://sqlalchemy-ibmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Known Limitations

1) Non-standard SQL queries are not supported. e.g. "SELECT ? FROM TAB1"
2) For updations involving primary/foreign key references, the entries should be made in correct order. Integrity check is always on and thus the primary keys referenced by the foreign keys in the referencing tables should always exist in the parent table.
3) Unique key which contains nullable column not supported
4) UPDATE CASCADE for foreign keys not supported
5) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY deferred not supported
6) Subquery in ON clause of LEFT OUTER JOIN not supported
