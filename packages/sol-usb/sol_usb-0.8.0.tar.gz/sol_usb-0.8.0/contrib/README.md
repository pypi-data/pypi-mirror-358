# Misc / 'Contributed' Files

This folder contains files that are not supported as part of the core SOL project, but which may be useful to users anyway.

Contents:

 - `54-sol-uaccess.rules` -- _udev_ rules that grant users physically present at a machine access to SOL devices. Recommended for most desktop Linux users.
 - `54-sol-plugdev.rules` -- _udev_ rules that grant users in the `plugdev` group access to SOL devices. Recommended for systems where you'll be accessing the tools remotely; e.g. via SSH.
