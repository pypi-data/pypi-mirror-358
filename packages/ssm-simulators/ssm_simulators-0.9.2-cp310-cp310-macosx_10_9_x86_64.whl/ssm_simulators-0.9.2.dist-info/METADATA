### Quick Start

The `ssms` package serves two purposes.

1. Easy access to *fast simulators of sequential sampling models*
2. Support infrastructure to construct training data for various approaches to likelihood / posterior amortization

We provide two minimal examples here to illustrate how to use each of the two capabilities.

#### Install

Let's start with *installing* the `ssms` package.

You can do so by typing,

`pip install ssm-simulators`

in your terminal.

Below you find a basic tutorial on how to use the package.

#### Tutorial
