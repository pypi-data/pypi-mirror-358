Next version
============


2.6 (2025-06-30)
================

- Fixed crashes when feeding control characters into the sanitizer.
- Fixed a problem with an overly specific test.


2.5 (2024-12-19)
================

- **Vulnerability:** Fixed an issue where normalizing unicode too late in the
  process would keep disallowed tags when using specially crafted HTML. Fixed
  in 2.4.2.
- Fixed missing whitespace while merging adjacent tags.
- Raised the minimum lxml-html-clean version to 0.4 because of a reported
  vulnerability. We were already compatible, but enforcing the lower bound
  makes sense.


2.4 (2024-04-01)
================

- Fixed an edge case where ``br`` tag attributes weren't removed if the br tag
  appears first.
- Updated the ``lxml`` dependency to 5.2 and added the now-required
  ``lxml[html_clean]`` extra.


2.3 (2024-02-07)
================

- Avoided adding whitespace when merging tags of the same type.
- Updated the tests.
- Switched from black to the ruff formatter.


2.2 (2023-07-03)
================

- Changed ``keep_normalized_whitespace`` to preserve whitespace at the tail of
  tags, not just between tags.
- Changed the parameters of ``normalize_whitespace_in_text_or_tail`` to be
  keyword-only.


2.1 (2023-06-29)
================

- Added a test for a type of misconfiguration.
- Changed the sanitizer configuration validation to not allow unexpected data
  types in ``tags``, ``empty``, ``separate``, ``whitespace`` and
  ``attributes``.


2.0 (2023-06-28)
================

- Raised the minimum Python version to 3.7. Added Python 3.10, 3.11.
- Raised the minimum lxml version to the current 4.9.1.
- Switched from Travis CI to GitHub actions. Added Python 3.9 to the CI
  matrix.
- Renamed the main branch to main.
- Switched to a declarative setup.
- Fixed a whitespace dependency in the testsuite.
- Switched to hatchling and ruff.
- Made behavior-altering arguments to ``normalize_overall_whitespace``
  keyword-only.


`1.9`_ (2020-01-20)
===================

- Added Python 3.8 to the CI matrix.
- Be able to keep the ``<style>`` tag by adding it to ``tags``.
- Added a style check to the CI matrix.


`1.8`_ (2019-11-21)
===================

- Actually added support for customizing lxml's autolinking behavior
  using a dictionary argument.
- Stopped removing explicitly allowed attributes.
- Removed ``id`` from allowed attributes of ``<a>`` tags to provide
  an additional layer of defense against DOM clobbering attacks.
- Added an element preprocessor which assigns the ``id`` value to
  the ``name`` attribute of anchors if ``name`` isn't set or empty. This
  should provide additional backwards compatibility making the ``id``
  removal less of a problem when using named anchors.


`1.7`_ (2019-02-19)
===================

- Added a system check which validates sanitizer configurations early
  when using Django.
- Fixed an edge case where passing in an empty allowed tags list would
  unexpectedly and silently not remove any tags at all (because that's
  the way lxml's cleaner works).
- Changed the sanitizer ``tags``, ``empty`` and ``separate`` options to
  also accept any iterable, not just sets.
- Changed the ``lru_cache`` import in the Django module to try
  ``functools`` first.
- Fixed the tag merging to also check tags in ``empty``. This means that
  e.g. consecutive ``<hr>`` tags are also merged now when using the
  default settings.
- Made it possible to override the set of tags processed as whitespace.
  The default set is ``{"br"}`` which preserves the current behavior of
  stripping breaks from the beginning or end of tags' content.


`1.6`_ (2018-06-29)
===================

- Fixed another edge case where a tag which is allowed to be empty was
  erroneously removed if it contained not only whitespace but also a
  ``<br>`` tag.


`1.5`_ (2018-06-01)
===================

- Fixed a few edge whitespace normalization edge cases and a bug where
  removing an empty tag removed all whitespace.
- Added `black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ for automatically
  formatting the Python code.
- By default, links with ``target="_blank"`` get an additional
  ``rel="noopener"`` attribute (`Article by Mathias Bynens
  <https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/>`_). If you're
  overriding the list of allowed attributes for anchor tags you must
  add ``rel`` to your list.


`1.4`_ (2018-03-29)
===================

- Corrected the required lxml version in ``install_requires``.
- Added comments and testing for more edge cases.
- Changed the cleaner to not drop form elements; instead, ``<form>`` is
  converted to ``<p>``, and form elements are preserved.
- Added an ``is_mergeable`` hook for conditionally preventing the
  merging of adjacent elements.
- Fixed a case where paragraphs were allowed inside paragraphs (which
  was never the idea).


`1.3`_ (2017-09-22)
===================

- Fixed a case where tags with content between them were erroneously merged.
- Added a ``tox.ini`` file for running style checks and tests.
- Replaced ``REPLACEMENTS`` and ``element_filters`` with the more
  general ``element_preprocessors`` and ``element_postprocessors``
  settings.
- Removed the restriction that ``<span>`` tags are never allowed.


`1.2`_ (2017-05-25)
===================

- Fixed the erroneous removal of all whitespace between adjacent
  elements.
- Fixed a few occasions where ``<br>`` tags were erroneously removed.
- Back to beautifulsoup4 for especially broken HTML respectively HTML
  with Emojis on macOS.
- Used a ``<div>`` instead of ``<anything>`` to wrap the document (since
  beautifulsoup4 does not like custom tags too much)


`1.1`_ (2017-05-02)
===================

- Added ``html_sanitizer.django.get_sanitizer`` to provide an official
  way of configuring HTML sanitizers using Django settings.


`1.0`_ (2017-05-02)
===================

- Initial public release.
