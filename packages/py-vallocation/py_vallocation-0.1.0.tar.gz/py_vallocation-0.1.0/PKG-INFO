# Py-vAllocation

Py-vAllocation is a Python package for asset allocation with a primary focus on integrating investor views.

## Features

It's yet another portfolio optimization library, but unlike many others, **Py-vAllocation** aims to:
- Be modular and beginner-friendly, while remaining flexible and customizable for advanced users  
- Support Variance, CVaR and Robust Bayesian optimisation, using either mean/variance distributions or scenario probabilities
- Avoid hidden assumptions or black-box components — every modeling choice is explicitly stated  
- Incorporate investor views via historical flexible probabilities using entropy pooling and the Black-Litterman methodology  
- Support shrinkage estimators and other Bayesian estimation methods  


## Installation

Since Py-vAllocation is under active development and not yet published on PyPI, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enexqnt/py-vallocation.git
cd py-vallocation
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

See [examples here](examples/)


## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy >= 1.20.0
- cvxopt >= 1.2.0
- pandas (optional, recommended for enhanced functionality)
  - check availability via `pyvallocation.optional.HAS_PANDAS`

## Development Status

**Alpha release**: Under active development. Many features are not yet implemented or fully tested. Breaking changes may occur without notice. Use at your own risk.
