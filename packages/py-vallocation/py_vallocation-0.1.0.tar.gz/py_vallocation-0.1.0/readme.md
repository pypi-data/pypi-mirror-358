# Py-vAllocation

Py-vAllocation is a Python package for asset allocation with a primary focus on integrating investor views.

## Features

It's yet another portfolio optimization library, but unlike many others, **Py-vAllocation** aims to:
- Be modular and beginner-friendly, while remaining flexible and customizable for advanced users  
- Support Variance, CVaR and Robust Bayesian optimisation, using either mean/variance distributions or scenario probabilities
- Avoid hidden assumptions or black-box components — every modeling choice is explicitly stated  
- Incorporate investor views via historical flexible probabilities using entropy pooling and the Black-Litterman methodology  
- Support shrinkage estimators and other Bayesian estimation methods
