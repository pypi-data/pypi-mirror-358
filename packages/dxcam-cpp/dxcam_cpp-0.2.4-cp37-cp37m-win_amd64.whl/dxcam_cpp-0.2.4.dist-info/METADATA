# DXCam-CPP

A high performance screen capturing library for Windows
rewriting [DXcam](https://github.com/ra1nty/DXcam) in C++.

## Usage

```shell
pip install dxcam-cpp
```

The interface of the Python module of DXCam_CPP is designed to be **fully
compatible** with the original Python DXcam as an alternative.
