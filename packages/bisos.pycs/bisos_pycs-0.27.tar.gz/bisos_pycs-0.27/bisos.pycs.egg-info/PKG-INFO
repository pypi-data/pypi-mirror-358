Overview
========

`Python Command Services <https://github.com/bisos-pip/pycs>`__ is a
unified model and framework for development of both Commands and
Services. Unlike `Click <https://github.com/pallets/click>`__, Docopt
and Typer which are just for commands development and unlike
`FastAPI <https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi>`__, Pydantic, gRPC and
OpenAPI which are just for services development, PyCS does both. Native
PyCS uses `RPyC <https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/rpyc>`__ to
transform commands into services.

*bisos.PyCS* is based on PyCS-Foundation (bisos.b) and can be used both
as a Command and as a Service (invoke/perform model of remote
operations) using RPyC for central management of multiple systems.
PyCS-Framework extends the PyCS-Foundation by providing common
additional modules which ease development of applications.

About BISOS — ByStar Internet Services Operating System
=======================================================

Layered on top of Debian, **BISOS**: (By\* Internet Services Operating
System) is a unified and universal framework for developing both
internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
services. See `Bootstrapping ByStar, BISOS and
Blee <https://github.com/bxGenesis/start>`__ for information about
getting started with BISOS.

*bisos.PyCS* as a PyCS facility is a small piece of a much bigger
picture. **BISOS** is a foundation for **The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital
Ecosystem** which is described as a cure for losses of autonomy and
privacy that we are experiencing in a book titled: `Nature of
Polyexistentials <https://github.com/bxplpc/120033>`__

bisos.PyCS is a Command Services (PyCS) Facility
================================================

bisos.PyCS can be used locally on command-line or remotely as a service.
bisos.PyCS is a PyCS multi-unit command-service. PyCS is a framework
that converges developement of CLI and Services. PyCS is an alternative
to FastAPI, Typer and Click.

bisos.PyCS uses the PyCS Framework to:

#. Provide access to PyCS facilities through native python.
#. Provide local access to PyCS facilities on CLI.
#. Provide remote access to PyCS facilities through remote invocation of
   python Expection Complete Operations using
   `rpyc <https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/rpyc>`__.
#. Provide remote access to PyCS facilities on CLI.

What is unique in the PyCS-Framework is that these four models are all a
single abstraction.

The core of PyCS-Framework is the *bisos.b* package (the
PyCS-Foundation). See https://github.com/bisos-pip/b for an overview.

Uses of bisos.PyCS
==================

Within BISOS, bisos.PyCS is used as a common facility.

bisos.PyCS as a Standalone Piece of BISOS
=========================================

bisos.PyCS is a standalone piece of BISOS. It can be used as a
self-contained Python package separate from BISOS. Follow the
installtion and usage instructions below for your own use.

Installation
============

The sources for the bisos.PyCS pip package is maintained at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/PyCS.

The bisos.PyCS pip package is available at PYPI as
https://pypi.org/project/bisos.PyCS

You can install bisos.PyCS with pip or pipx.

With pip
--------

If you need access to bisos.PyCS as a python module, you can install it
with pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip install bisos.PyCS

With pipx
---------

If you only need access to bisos.PyCS as a command on command-line, you
can install it with pipx:

.. code:: bash

   pipx install bisos.PyCS

The following commands are made available:

-  PyCS.cs
-  roInv-PyCS.cs
-  roPerf-PyCS.cs

These are all one file with 3 names. *roInv-PyCS.cs* and
*roPerf-PyCS.cs* are sym-links to *PyCS.cs*

Usage
=====

Locally (system command-line)
-----------------------------

``PyCS.cs`` can be invoked directly as

.. code:: bash

   bin/PyCS.cs

Remotely (as a service – Performer+Invoker)
-------------------------------------------

You can also run

Performer
~~~~~~~~~

Run performer as:

.. code:: bash

   bin/roPerf-PyCS.cs

Invoker
~~~~~~~

Run invoker as:

.. code:: bash

   bin/roInv-PyCS.cs

Use by Python script
--------------------

Documentation and Blee-Panels
=============================

bisos.PyCS is part of ByStar Digital Ecosystem http://www.by-star.net.

This module's primary documentation is in the form of Blee-Panels.
Additional information is also available in:
http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/180047
