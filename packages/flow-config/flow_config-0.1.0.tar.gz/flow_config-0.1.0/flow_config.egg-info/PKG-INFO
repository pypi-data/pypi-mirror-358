# 🔧 ConfigFlow

**ConfigFlow** is a Python library for managing configuration files with real-time monitoring and event-driven updates.  
Supports **JSON**, **YAML**, and more — with validation and a simple API.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Unified Parsing**: Load JSON, YAML, and other formats.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detect config changes instantly using `watchdog`.
- **Event-Driven**: Register callbacks for config updates.
- **Validation**: Ensure configs match your schema with `pydantic`.

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install configflow
```

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

```python
from configflow import ConfigFlow

# Initialize with a config file
config = ConfigFlow("settings.yaml")

# Define a schema
schema = {"port": int, "debug": bool}

# Register a callback
@config.on_change
def handle_update(changed_config):
    print(f"Config updated: {changed_config}")

# Load and watch
config.load(schema=schema)
config.watch()

# Keep running (Ctrl+C to stop)
try:
    while True:
        pass
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    config.stop()
```

---

## 📝 Example Config (`settings.yaml`)

```yaml
port: 8080
debug: true
```
