# ycpm: Your Clyp Package Manager

Your Clyp Package Manager (ycpm) is a command-line tool designed to simplify the management of Clyp packages. It allows you to install, update, and manage packages from various sources, including GitHub. You can also create, build, and publish your own packages with ease.

## Features

- Install packages from GitHub and other sources (GitHub is currently supported)
- Uninstall and list installed packages
- Create new Clyp packages with a single command
- Build packages into distributable `.cpak` files
- Simple, user-friendly CLI

## Installation

To install ycpm, use pip:

```bash
pip install ycpm
```

> **Note:** Clyp 0.3.0+ should install ycpm automatically. To check if ycpm is already installed, run:
>
> ```bash
> ycpm --version
> ```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ycpm
```

## Usage

### Install a Package

Install a package from GitHub (the default and currently only supported source):

```bash
ycpm install gh <author>/<repository>
```

### Uninstall a Package

```bash
ycpm uninstall <package_name>
```

### Create a New Package

```bash
ycpm new <package_name>
```

This creates a new package structure in the current directory, including a `ycpm.json` file for package configuration.

### Build a Package

```bash
ycpm build
```

This creates a `.cpak` file for distribution. The filename **must** match your package name for publishing (e.g., on your GitHub releases page).

### List Installed Packages

```bash
ycpm list
```

## Troubleshooting & Help

- For help on any command, run:

  ```bash
  ycpm --help
  ```

- If you encounter issues, ensure you are using the latest version of ycpm and Clyp.
