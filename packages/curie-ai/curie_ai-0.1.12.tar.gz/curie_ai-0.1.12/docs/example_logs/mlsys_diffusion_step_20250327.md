# Lab Report: Effect of Sampling Steps on Inference Time for a Pre-trained Diffusion Model on MNIST

## Abstract

This report investigates the relationship between the number of sampling steps and the inference time of a pre-trained diffusion model applied to the MNIST dataset. The hypothesis posits that reducing sampling steps will reduce inference time, potentially exhibiting a linear or sub-linear relationship. Utilizing a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with U-Net architecture and applying deterministic sampling via DDIM, experiments are conducted with varying sampling steps (10, 50, 100). The study concludes that inference time decreases sub-linearly, with diminishing returns as sampling steps further reduce.

## Introduction

The research question guiding this experiment explores the effect of decreasing sampling steps on the inference time of a pre-trained diffusion model, specifically examining whether the relationship is linear or sub-linear. Diffusion models have garnered attention due to their efficacy in generating high-quality images. However, their computational intensity necessitates exploration of methods to optimize inference time, particularly by adjusting sampling steps. 

The hypothesis suggests that reducing sampling steps will decrease the inference time of the DDPM model functioning on MNIST data, potentially following a linear or sub-linear trajectory.

## Methodology

### Design

The experimental design encompasses:
- **Independent Variable:** Sampling Steps (10, 50, 100).
- **Dependent Variable:** Inference Time (seconds).
- **Control Variables:** Diffusion model configuration, DDIM sampling method, linear noise schedule, batch size, image size, dataset, noise initialization, hardware, and framework.

### Experimental Setup

1. **Model Configuration:**
   - Diffusion Model: Pre-trained DDPM with U-Net backbone (1000 timesteps) from Hugging Face.
   - U-Net Architecture: 3 down-blocks with 64, 128, 256 filters; 3 up-blocks; time embedding dimension of 64.
   - Noise Schedule: Linear beta schedule (beta_start=0.0001, beta_end=0.02).
   - Sampling Method: Deterministic DDIM initialization with varying sampling steps.
   - Dataset: MNIST, generating grayscale images of size 28x28.

2. **Implementation and Execution:**
   - Noise generated from normal distribution N(0, 1).
   - Two experimental runs conducted for each sampling configuration (10, 50, 100 steps).
   - Performed on NVIDIA A40 using PyTorch framework and pre-trained weights from Hugging Face.

### Execution Details

Experiments were conducted across control and experimental groups. For each configuration (10, 50, 100 sampling steps), ten images were generated from random noise, measuring the complete inference process. This included initialization and result collation into an averaged measure across two experimental runs.

## Results

Table 1 showcases average inference times across varying sampling steps:

| Sampling Steps | Run 1 Average Inference Time (seconds) | Run 2 Average Inference Time (seconds) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 10             | 0.328 seconds                          | 0.327 seconds                          |
| 50             | 1.542 seconds                          | 1.531 seconds                          |
| 100 (Control)  | 3.031 seconds                          | 3.018 seconds                          |

Throughout both experimental runs, results substantiate a trend of decreased inference times with reduced sampling steps.

## Analysis

The analysis indicates:
- Sub-linear decrease in inference time: A modest reduction occurs when decreasing the sampling steps from 100 to 50, while more acute reduction is evident from 50 to 10.
- Data confirms that the change from 100 to 50 steps achieves nearly a halving in inference time while the latter adjustment (from 50 to 10) does not proportionately halve the already reduced time.

Thus, results meet expectations set by the hypothesis.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The experiment confirms the hypothesis, revealing a sub-linear relationship between sampling steps and inference time for the DDPM model on MNIST. This underlines the potential of optimizing diffusion models for more efficient deployment in real-world scenes requiring rapid image generation.

Further exploration could involve balancing efficiency against quality, probing into sampling techniques that might afford equivalent inference speed gains with enhanced image fidelity. Adjustments to hyperparameters or model layers could offer new fronts for reducing model complexity while maintaining performance metrics closely aligned to practical needs.
