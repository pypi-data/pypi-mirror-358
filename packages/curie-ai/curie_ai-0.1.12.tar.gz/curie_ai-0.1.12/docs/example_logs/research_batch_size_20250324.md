# Experiment Report: Investigating the Impact of Batch Size on Model Performance Using MNIST Dataset

## Abstract

This report examines the effects of batch size on model performance, specifically focusing on test accuracy and average training time per epoch. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch, models are trained on the MNIST dataset with varying batch sizes of 16, 64, 128, and 256. The experimental results demonstrate that increasing the batch size generally enhances test accuracy and significantly reduces training time per epoch, supporting the hypothesis that batch size affects both accuracy and training efficiency.

## Introduction

### Research Question

How does the batch size influence model performance on the MNIST dataset, particularly in terms of test accuracy and training speed?

### Hypothesis

The experiment is based on the hypothesis that the batch size in model training affects test accuracy and average training time per epoch.

### Background

Batch size is a parameter defining the number of samples processed before updating the model parameters. It is crucial in determining computational efficiency and may impact model generalization. When training models using deep learning architectures, understanding the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency based on batch size selection is vital. Therefore, this experiment seeks to clarify how batch size affects these key aspects in training a CNN on the MNIST dataset.

## Methodology

### Experimental Design

A CNN model is configured with two convolutional layers, each having 32 filters and using a 3x3 kernel size with ReLU activations followed by a 2x2 max-pooling layer. After flattening, it feeds into a fully connected layer for classification. The models are trained using varying batch sizes (16, 64, 128, 256).

### Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: MNIST
- **Train/Test Split**: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- **Device**: GPU for efficiency
- **Model Architecture**: CNN with specified layers and activations
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001
- **Number of Epochs**: 10
- **Metrics**: Test accuracy, average training time per epoch
- **Control Group**: Batch size 16
- **Experimental Group**: Batch sizes 64, 128, 256

### Execution Progress

For each batch size, models are trained using the PyTorch framework, and metrics are recorded across 10 epochs. The results are meticulously saved in designated directories for subsequent analysis.

## Results

### Control Group (Batch Size: 16)

- **Test Accuracy**: 98.99% (Average of two runs: 98.98%, 99.00%)
- **Average Training Time per Epoch**: 16.91 seconds (Average of two runs: 16.46s, 17.36s)

### Experimental Group

- **Batch Size: 64**
  - Test Accuracy: 99.11%
  - Average Training Time per Epoch: 8.77 seconds

- **Batch Size: 128**
  - Test Accuracy: 99.04%
  - Average Training Time per Epoch: 7.89 seconds

- **Batch Size: 256**
  - Test Accuracy: 99.14%
  - Average Training Time per Epoch: 7.53 seconds

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Summary of Findings

The findings corroborate the hypothesis that batch size influences both test accuracy and training efficiency. Larger batch sizes marginally improve test accuracy, likely enhancing generalization. In contrast, they substantially reduce training time per epoch, possibly reflecting optimized hardware utilization.

### Recommendations

Given the objectives are adequately addressed and the hypothesis confirmed, no additional experiments are deemed necessary under the current scope. However, future work might explore different model architectures, larger datasets, or additional batch size configurations to deepen understanding of batch size effects in varied contexts.
