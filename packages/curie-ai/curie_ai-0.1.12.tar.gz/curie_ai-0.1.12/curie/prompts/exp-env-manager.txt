Given the following research question, please recommend the Python packages needed to install in order to effectively address the question.
I plan to write and execute code to answer the question, so the packages should support code execution and any necessary functionality for implementing the solution. If machine learning task is involved, prioritize torch over tensorflow.
We will run `pip install <package>` later in our environment.
Please return the output as a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "packages": [
    "package1",
    "package2",
    ...
  ]
}
