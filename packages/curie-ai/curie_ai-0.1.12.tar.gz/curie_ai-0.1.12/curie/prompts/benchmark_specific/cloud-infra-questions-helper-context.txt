AWS Cloud infrastructure related additional context:
- Do not use AWS Management Console, as you don't have GUI access.
- For VMs, a new key pair must be created (or the private key must already exist locally), otherwise you will not be able to SSH into the newly created VM. 
- aws_cli is ALREADY installed.
