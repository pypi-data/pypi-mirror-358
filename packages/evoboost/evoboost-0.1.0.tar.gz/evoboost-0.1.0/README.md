# EvoBoost

**Inventor**: Sudip Barua

EvoBoost is a next-generation machine learning algorithm that extends gradient boosting by introducing probabilistic residuals and interpretable updates for classification and regression.

## Installation

```bash
pip install evoboost
```

## Usage

```python
from evoboost import EvoBoostClassifier

model = EvoBoostClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```
