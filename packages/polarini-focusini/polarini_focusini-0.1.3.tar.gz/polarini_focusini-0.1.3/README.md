# Polarini Focusini

Automated **in-focus region detector** that blends monocular depth estimation with classic frequency-domain (Difference of Gaussian - **DoG**) sharpness cues.

# Example

# What happens under the hood

1. Runs **[Depth-Anything V2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2)** to get floating-point depth.  
2. Builds a 3-level **Gaussian pyramid** and two **Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)** maps.  
3. Applies **Non-Maximum Suppression** in space *and* across scales.  
4. Keeps only strong extrema ‚Üí votes for focus ‚Üí finds dominant depth bins.  
5. Saves every intermediate step to a per-image `debug/` folder for easy inspection.
