# IP Geolocation MCP Server

This is a simple [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that uses the [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) API to get detailed information about an IP address.
This can be used to determine where the user is located (approximately) and what network they are used.

## Installation

You'll need to create a token to use the IPInfo API.
If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free account at https://ipinfo.io/signup.

While each client has its own way of specifying, you'll generally use the following values:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Command** | `uvx` |
| **Arguments** | `mcp-server-ipinfo` |
| **Environment** | `IPINFO_API_TOKEN` = `<YOUR TOKEN>` |


### Development Version

If you'd like to use the latest and greatest, the server can be pulled straight from GitHub.
Just add an additional `--from` argument:
--from git+https://github.com/briandconnelly/mcp-server-ipinfo mcp-server-ipinfo


| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Command** | `uvx` |
| **Arguments** | `--from`, `git+https://github.com/briandconnelly/mcp-server-ipinfo`, `mcp-server-ipinfo` |
| **Environment** | `IPINFO_API_TOKEN` = `<YOUR TOKEN>` |
