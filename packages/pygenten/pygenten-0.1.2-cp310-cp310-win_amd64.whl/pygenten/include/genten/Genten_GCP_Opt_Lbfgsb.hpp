   *  Compute an estimate of the best rank-R GCP model of a tensor X
   *  for a given lost function.  The input X currently must be a dense
   *  tensor.  The result is a Ktensor.
   *
   *  An initial guess of factor matrices must be provided, which must be
   *  nonzero.
   *
   *  @param[in] x          Data tensor to be fit by the model.
   *  @param[in,out] u      Input contains an initial guess for the factors.
   *                        The size of each mode must match the corresponding
   *                        mode of x, and the number of components determines
   *                        how many will be in the result.
   *                        Output contains resulting factorization Ktensor.
   *  @param[in] algParams  Genten algorithm/solver parameters
   *  @param[out] history   Performance history for each step of the algorithm
