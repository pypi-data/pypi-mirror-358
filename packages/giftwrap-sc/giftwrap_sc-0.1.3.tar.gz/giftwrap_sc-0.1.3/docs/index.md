This package provides tools for dealing with GIFT-seq data. The `giftwrap` package is designed for both processing of GIFT-seq raw data and provides tools for downstream analysis of GIFT-seq data.

## Main Features
- **Data Processing**: Tools for processing GIFT-seq-based FastQ files into counts matrices.
- **Basic QC**: Automatic quality control of GIFT-seq data based on 10X Cell Ranger cell calls on the paired transcriptomes.
- **Downstream Analysis**: Functions for filtering and analyzing GIFT-seq data, including single-cell genotyping and imputation.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Tools for spatial analysis of GIFT-seq data, including visualization and spatial clustering.
