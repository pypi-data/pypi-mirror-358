Q) Why am I getting messages about "IMPLICIT statement not positioned
correctly within the scoping unit"?  

A) Of necessity, the template header files include an "IMPLICIT NONE"
statement.  Users should not put their own "IMPLICIT NONE" statement.
Likewise only CPP token/macro/include definitions and Fortran USE
statements should appear before the CPP include statement for the
template.
