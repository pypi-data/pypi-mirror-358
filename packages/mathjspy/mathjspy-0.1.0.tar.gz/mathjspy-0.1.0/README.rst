========

`mathjspy` is a Python library to evaluate mathematical expressions in the same manner as `MathJS <https://mathjs.org>`_.

The purpose is to allow calculation of expressions in Python that are consistent with what is calculated through MathJS.

Many thanks to `MathJS <https://mathjs.org>`_ for their hard work in developing an excellent mathematical expression interpreter.
