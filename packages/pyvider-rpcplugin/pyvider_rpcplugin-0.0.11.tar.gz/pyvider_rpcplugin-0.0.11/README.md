### Installation

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv add pyvider-rpcplugin

# With pip
pip install pyvider-rpcplugin
```

### Hello, RPC World!

Create your first RPC plugin in minutes. This example demonstrates a client application launching a simple plugin server (as a separate Python script/executable) and connecting to it.

**Note on mTLS**: For simplicity, these examples run with mTLS disabled (`PLUGIN_AUTO_MTLS=False` is set by `example_utils.configure_for_example()`). In production, mTLS is highly recommended. See `examples/05_security_mtls.py` for mTLS setup.

**1. The Plugin Server Executable (`examples/00_dummy_server.py`)**

This script acts as a minimal executable plugin. When run, it starts an RPC server using a basic protocol and a simple handler. It's designed to be launched by a client process.

```python
# Condensed from examples/00_dummy_server.py
import asyncio
# Imports for pyvider.rpcplugin, logger, and example_utils are present in the actual file
# from example_utils import configure_for_example
# configure_for_example() # Sets up paths and default config (like disabling mTLS)

from pyvider.rpcplugin import plugin_protocol, plugin_server
from pyvider.telemetry import logger

class DummyHandler: # Basic handler
    async def NoOp(self, request, context):
        logger.info("DummyHandler: NoOp called (should not occur in this example)")
        return {}

async def main():
    # configure_for_example() is called at module level.
    # It sets default magic cookie (key & value) and disables mTLS.
    # The launching client is expected to set the correct magic cookie environment variable.
    protocol = plugin_protocol() # Basic protocol
    server = plugin_server(protocol=protocol, handler=DummyHandler())
    logger.info("Dummy server starting (will print handshake string to stdout)...")
    await server.serve() # Prints handshake, then serves until stopped by client
    logger.info("Dummy server stopped.")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```
You typically don't run `00_dummy_server.py` directly in this scenario; it's launched by the client. If you were to run it independently (e.g., for direct testing with `01b_direct_client_connection.py`), it would start and wait for connections.

**2. The Client Application (`examples/01_quick_start.py`)**

This script acts as the client (or host application). It uses `plugin_client` to launch the `00_dummy_server.py` script as a subprocess and then connects to it.

```python
# Condensed from examples/01_quick_start.py
import asyncio
import sys
from pathlib import Path
# Imports for pyvider.rpcplugin, logger, and example_utils are present
# from example_utils import configure_for_example
# configure_for_example() # Sets up paths and default config

from pyvider.rpcplugin import plugin_client
from pyvider.telemetry import logger

async def main():
    # configure_for_example() called at module level.
    example_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    dummy_server_executable = example_dir / "00_dummy_server.py"
    dummy_server_command = [sys.executable, str(dummy_server_executable)]

    client = None
    try:
        logger.info(f"Client launching plugin: {' '.join(dummy_server_command)}")
        # plugin_client reads its config (e.g., magic cookie key/value from
        # configure_for_example) and sets the required environment variable
        # (e.g., PYVIDER_PLUGIN_MAGIC_COOKIE) for the dummy_server_command process.
        client = plugin_client(command=dummy_server_command)
        await client.start() # Starts the server executable and connects via handshake

        logger.info("Client connected to dummy_server plugin successfully!")
        # The dummy_server uses a basic protocol with no custom RPC methods.
        # If it defined services (e.g., via .proto files), you would create a
        # gRPC stub here using client.grpc_channel and make calls:
        # stub = YourServiceStub(client.grpc_channel)
        # response = await stub.YourMethod(YourRequest())
        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Keep connection alive for a moment

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Client error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    finally:
        if client and client.is_started:
            await client.close() # Stops the server executable too
            logger.info("Client closed, dummy_server plugin stopped.")
        elif client: # If client was created but not started
            await client.close()


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```
To run this Quick Start example:
`python examples/01_quick_start.py`

This setup demonstrates the typical plugin model where the client (host application) manages the lifecycle of the plugin executable. The `plugin_client` handles launching the process, the handshake (including magic cookie authentication and transport negotiation), and establishing the gRPC connection.

## üß© Core Concepts & Use Cases

### What is a Plugin Architecture?
A plugin architecture allows you to extend a core application with modular, independently developed components called plugins. These plugins run as separate processes, communicating with the main application via well-defined interfaces (often RPC). Key benefits include:
- **Modularity**: Features can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Isolation**: A crash in one plugin doesn't necessarily bring down the core application.
- **Flexibility**: Different plugins can even be written in different languages (though `pyvider.rpcplugin` focuses on Python plugins).
- **Security**: Plugins can be sandboxed, limiting their access to system resources.

`pyvider.rpcplugin` provides the tools to build and manage the RPC communication layer for such an architecture in Python.

### When to Use `pyvider.rpcplugin`?
Consider `pyvider.rpcplugin` when:
- You need to extend your Python application with out-of-process plugins for enhanced modularity or security isolation.
- You're building a system where components (plugins) communicate via efficient, type-safe RPC, especially if they are on the same machine (leveraging Unix domain sockets) or across a network (using TCP with mTLS).
- High-performance Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is critical.
- You value clear service contracts defined via Protocol Buffers (protobufs).
- End-to-end security with mutual TLS (mTLS) is a requirement for plugin communication.
- You want to standardize plugin communication with features like magic cookie authentication and common configuration patterns.
- You prefer an async-native framework that integrates well with Python's `asyncio`.

It simplifies the complexities of setting up and managing gRPC connections, security, and configuration for these scenarios.

### Comparison to Alternatives
While many RPC and IPC mechanisms exist, `pyvider.rpcplugin` offers a specific set of advantages for plugin architectures:
- **vs. Direct gRPC**: Building directly with `grpcio` gives you full control but requires significant boilerplate for server/client setup, security handshakes, transport management, and configuration, especially in a plugin context. `pyvider.rpcplugin` automates these, providing pre-configured patterns for mTLS, magic cookie authentication, and transport negotiation, letting you focus on your service logic.
- **vs. `go-plugin`**: HashiCorp's `go-plugin` is a mature framework for Go that heavily inspired `pyvider.rpcplugin`. `pyvider.rpcplugin` aims to bring a similar level of robustness and ease-of-use to the Python ecosystem, leveraging Python-specific features like `asyncio` and rich type hinting. If you're familiar with `go-plugin`'s concepts, you'll find `pyvider.rpcplugin` follows similar patterns for secure, versioned RPC.
- **vs. Other Python RPC Libraries (e.g., RPyC, Pyro5, Nameko)**:
    - Many traditional Python RPC libraries are excellent for general-purpose RPC.
    - `pyvider.rpcplugin` differentiates itself by being built on gRPC, offering high performance and leveraging Protocol Buffers for service definitions, which is beneficial for type safety and cross-language interop (if the host application isn't Python).
    - Its primary focus is on the out-of-process, secure plugin model, with built-in mTLS and handshake mechanisms tailored for this.
    - Some alternatives might be simpler for basic Python-to-Python RPC but may not offer the same level of performance, security features for untrusted plugins, or the strict contract definitions of gRPC.

### Client Connection Scenarios

There are two main ways a client connects:

**1. Connecting to an Independently Running Server**

If you have a `pyvider.rpcplugin` server already running (e.g., started manually or by another process), you can connect to it directly using `grpc.aio` if you know its transport address (like a Unix socket path or TCP host/port).

See `examples/01b_direct_client_connection.py` for a runnable example. Here's a condensed version:

```python
# Condensed from examples/01b_direct_client_connection.py
import asyncio
import grpc # For grpc.aio.insecure_channel

async def run_direct_client(socket_path): # socket_path from running server
    target = f"unix:{socket_path}"
    channel = None
    try:
        # Assumes insecure connection; for mTLS use grpc.aio.secure_channel()
        channel = grpc.aio.insecure_channel(target)
        await asyncio.wait_for(channel.channel_ready(), timeout=5.0)
        print(f"Successfully connected directly to server at {target}")
        # Use channel with your gRPC stubs here
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Direct connection error: {e}")
    finally:
        if channel: await channel.close()

# To run this, you'd need a server running on 'socket_path'
# For example:
# server_socket = "/tmp/my_independent_server.sock" # Get this from your server's output
# asyncio.run(run_direct_client(server_socket))
```

**2. Client Launching and Connecting to a Plugin Executable**

This is the typical model for plugin architectures, where the host application (client) manages the lifecycle of the plugin executable. The `plugin_client` factory is used for this.

The "Hello, RPC World!" example earlier demonstrates this pattern using `examples/00_dummy_server.py` as the executable and `examples/01_quick_start.py` as the client that launches it. Here's a conceptual reminder:

```python
# Conceptual, see "Hello, RPC World!" or examples/01_quick_start.py for full version
from pyvider.rpcplugin import plugin_client

async def call_executable_plugin():
    # The 'command' launches your plugin server executable.
    # plugin_client handles handshake and connection.
    client = plugin_client(command=["python", "./path_to_your_plugin_server_script.py"])
    try:
        await client.start() # Launches the executable and connects

        # Now client.grpc_channel is available to use with your gRPC stubs
        # stub = YourServiceStub(client.grpc_channel)
        # response = await stub.YourMethod(YourRequest(data="..."))
        # print(f"Response from plugin: {response.message}")
        print("Client connected to executable plugin. Use client.grpc_channel.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error with executable plugin: {e}")
    finally:
        if client:
            await client.close() # Shuts down the plugin executable too
```

## üéØ Key Features

### üöÑ **Multiple Transport Options**

```python
# Unix Domain Sockets (fastest for local IPC)
server = plugin_server(protocol, handler, transport="unix")

# TCP Sockets (network communication)  
server = plugin_server(protocol, handler, transport="tcp", host="0.0.0.0", port=50051)

# The server will listen on the specified transport.
# Client-side configuration can then specify its preferred transports to connect with.
# (Refer to HandshakeConfig and client configuration for details on negotiation)
```

### üîê **mTLS Security Made Simple**

```python
from pyvider.rpcplugin import configure

# Configure mTLS with certificates
configure(
    PLUGIN_AUTO_MTLS=True,
    PLUGIN_SERVER_CERT="path/to/server.crt",
    PLUGIN_SERVER_KEY="path/to/server.key",
    PLUGIN_CLIENT_CERT="path/to/client.crt",
    PLUGIN_CLIENT_KEY="path/to/client.key"
)

# Certificates are automatically validated during TLS handshakes.
# Secure rotation of certificates is a complex operational process that typically
# involves out-of-band updates to certificate files and graceful restarts;
# this library focuses on using the configured certificates for mTLS.
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration**

```python
from pyvider.rpcplugin import RPCPluginConfig

# Programmatic configuration
config = RPCPluginConfig()
config.set("PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL", "DEBUG")
config.set("PLUGIN_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT", 30.0)

# Environment variable support
# PLUGIN_MAGIC_COOKIE=my-secret-cookie
# PLUGIN_AUTO_MTLS=true
# PLUGIN_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=unix,tcp
```

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for full details on all configuration options and methods.

### üìä **Built-in Observability**

```python
from pyvider.telemetry import logger

# Rich logging with context
logger.info(
    "RPC call completed",
    domain="rpc",
    action="call",
    status="success",
    method="SayHello",
    duration_ms=23.5,
    client_id="client-123"
)

# Automatic performance metrics
# Transport connection monitoring
# Error tracking and alerting
```

## üìà Performance

`pyvider.rpcplugin` is designed for high-performance scenarios:

| Metric | Unix Socket | TCP (localhost) | TCP (network) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Throughput** | 50K+ req/s | 25K+ req/s | 10K+ req/s |
| **Latency (p99)** | <1ms | <2ms | <10ms |
| **Memory Usage** | ~50MB | ~75MB | ~100MB |
| **CPU Overhead** | <5% | <10% | <15% |

*Benchmarks on modern hardware (8-core, 16GB RAM) with 1KB payloads*

### Performance Tips

```python
# Optimize for high throughput
server = plugin_server(
    protocol=protocol,
    handler=handler,
    transport="unix",  # Fastest for local IPC
    config={
        "PLUGIN_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT": 60.0,
        "PLUGIN_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT": 10.0
        # Note: Detailed gRPC server options (like max workers) are typically
        # configured directly on the grpc.aio.server if not exposed by RPCPluginServer.
    }
)

# For client-side optimization, manage client instances appropriately.
# If connecting to multiple different plugin executables, create separate
# RPCPluginClient instances for each.
# client = plugin_client(server_path="./path_to_your_plugin_executable")
# await client.start()
# # ... use client ...
# await client.close()
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Transport Implementation

```python
from pyvider.rpcplugin.transport.base import RPCPluginTransport

class CustomTransport(RPCPluginTransport):
    async def listen(self) -> str:
        # Implement custom server listening logic
        pass
    
    async def connect(self, endpoint: str) -> None:
        # Implement custom client connection logic  
        pass

# To use a custom transport, instantiate RPCPluginServer directly:
# custom_transport_instance = CustomTransport()
# server = RPCPluginServer(protocol=protocol, handler=handler, transport=custom_transport_instance)
# rather than using the plugin_server() factory.
```

### Protocol Factories

```python
from pyvider.rpcplugin import create_basic_protocol

# For testing and development
protocol = create_basic_protocol()

# Production protocol with custom validation
# Note: 'service_pb2' and 'add_ServiceServicer_to_server' are typically
# generated by grpc_tools from a your_service.proto definition.
protocol = plugin_protocol(
    service_name="ProductionService",
    descriptor_module=service_pb2, # e.g., from your_service_pb2.py
    servicer_add_fn=add_ServiceServicer_to_server # e.g., from your_service_pb2_grpc.py
)
```

### Production Configuration

```python
from pyvider.rpcplugin import configure

# Production-ready setup
configure(
    PLUGIN_MAGIC_COOKIE_VALUE="production-secret-key", # Or PLUGIN_MAGIC_COOKIE
    PLUGIN_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS=[1], # Server announces its supported versions
    # For server transport capabilities (server announces what it can do):
    PLUGIN_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=["unix", "tcp"],
    # For client transport preferences (client announces what it prefers):
    # PLUGIN_CLIENT_TRANSPORTS=["unix"],
    PLUGIN_AUTO_MTLS=True,
    PLUGIN_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT=30.0,
    PLUGIN_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=300.0,
    # Certificate paths for mTLS (server-side configuration)
    PLUGIN_SERVER_CERT="/etc/ssl/certs/server.crt",      # Server's own certificate
    PLUGIN_SERVER_KEY="/etc/ssl/private/server.key",     # Server's own private key
    PLUGIN_CLIENT_ROOT_CERTS="/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt"     # CA cert(s) to verify client certificates
    # Ensure these paths are accessible by the plugin process
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection refused errors:**
```python
# Check if server is running and endpoint is correct
server_info = await server.get_status()
logger.info("Server status", **server_info)
```

**Certificate validation failures:**
```python
# Verify certificate chain and expiration
from pyvider.rpcplugin.crypto.certificate import verify_certificate_chain
valid = verify_certificate_chain(cert_path, ca_path)
```

**Performance bottlenecks:**
```python
# Enable detailed performance logging
configure(PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG")
# Monitor metrics for bottleneck identification
```
