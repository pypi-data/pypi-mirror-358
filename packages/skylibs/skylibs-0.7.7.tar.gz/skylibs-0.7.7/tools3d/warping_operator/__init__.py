    Applies a warping operation to the environment map by simulating a camera translation along the z-axis
    (the environment map is approximated by a sphere, thus occlusions are not taken into account).
    The translation amount is determined by the sinus of the nadir angle.

    This code is a refactored version of the orignal implementation by Marc-André Gardner.
    The algorithm is described in the following paper:

        are at [0, 0, zOffset] and the ray directions are unchanged.

        The equation for the new coordinates is a simplified version the quadratic
        formula in the eq. 3 in the paper where we know v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2 = 1.
