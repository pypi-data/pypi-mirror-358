add TaskRecordView logic for merging context + report into one view object?

Auto-populate retries in your admin UI or API

Dynamic Task Lookup:
Implement a run_by_name("task_slug", kwargs) 
function to dynamically fetch and execute tasks from registered
plugins/modules.

Admin UI Enhancements:
Extend the admin UI/API to include retry dashboards, and live progress updates.

Improved Notification Hooks:
Expand the notifier framework to support additional events (such as task progress) 
and to auto-populate retry information in your UI.

Use this stream to live-update a task table without polling.
You can combine logs + status stream in the future if needed.
Want me to add this to your code or go even further with broadcast-to-room style WebSockets 
(e.g. multiple clients watching same task)?

broadcasting updates to multiple WebSocket clients (live dashboard style)
