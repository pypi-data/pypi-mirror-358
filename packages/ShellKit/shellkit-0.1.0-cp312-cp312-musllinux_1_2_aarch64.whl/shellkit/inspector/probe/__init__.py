"""
inspector.probe: reserved for --deep-thinking (not yet implemented)

This is an experimental submodule for future deep-layer inspection.

Design Notes:
- This is the only inspector submodule that may require external dependencies.

Planned use cases:
- On Linux:
    Experimental support for eBPF-based syscall tracing (e.g. via bcc or BPFtrace).
    Requires additional system-level tooling and Python bindings.

- On macOS:
    Will simulate syscall-level tracing using native wrappers or DTrace (if supported).

Currently inactive. Acts as a placeholder for future cross-layer observability tools.
