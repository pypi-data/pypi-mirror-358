LazyLabel is an intuitive, AI-assisted image segmentation tool built with a modern, modular architecture. It uses Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for quick, precise mask generation, alongside advanced polygon editing for fine-tuned control. Features comprehensive model management, customizable hotkeys, and outputs in clean, one-hot encoded `.npz` format for easy machine learning integration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
**Python 3.10+**

### Installation

#### For Users [via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lazylabel-gui/)
1.  Install LazyLabel directly:
    ```bash
    pip install lazylabel-gui
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    lazylabel-gui
    ```

#### For Developers (from Source)
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dnzckn/LazyLabel.git
    cd LazyLabel
    ```
2.  Install in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    lazylabel-gui
    ```

### Model Management
* **Default Storage**: Models are stored in `src/lazylabel/models/` directory
* **Custom Models**: Click "Browse Models" to select custom model folders  
* **Model Switching**: Use the dropdown to switch between available models
* **Auto-Detection**: Application automatically detects all `.pth` files in selected directories

**Note**: On the first run, the application will automatically download the SAM model checkpoint (~2.5 GB) from Meta's repository to the models directory. This is a one-time download.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Controls & Keybinds

> **üí° Tip**: All hotkeys are fully customizable! Click the "Hotkeys" button in the control panel to personalize your shortcuts.

### Modes
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `1` | Enter **Point Mode** (for AI segmentation). |
| `2` | Enter **Polygon Drawing Mode**. |
| `E` | Toggle **Selection Mode** to select existing segments. |
| `R` | Enter **Edit Mode** for selected polygons (drag shape or vertices). |
| `Q` | Toggle **Pan Mode** (click and drag the image). |

### Actions
| Key(s) | Action |
|---|---|
| `L-Click` | Add positive point (Point Mode) or polygon vertex. |
| `R-Click` | Add negative point (Point Mode). |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo last action. |
| `Ctrl + Y` / `Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo last action. |
| `Spacebar` | Finalize and save current AI segment. |
| `Enter` | **Save final mask for the current image to a `.npz` file.** |
| `M` | **Merge** selected segments into a single class. |
| `V` / `Delete` / `Backspace`| **Delete** selected segments. |
| `C` | Clear temporary points/vertices. |
| `W/A/S/D` | Pan image. |
| `Scroll Wheel` | Zoom-in or -out. |

## üì¶ Output Format

LazyLabel saves your work as a compressed NumPy array (`.npz`) with the same name as your image file.

The file contains a single data key, `'mask'`, holding a **one-hot encoded tensor** with the shape `(H, W, C)`:
* `H`: Image height.
* `W`: Image width.
* `C`: Total unique classes.

Each channel is a binary mask for a class, combining all assigned segments into a clean, ML-ready output.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LazyLabel features a modern, modular architecture designed for maintainability and extensibility:

* **Modular Design**: Clean separation between UI, business logic, and configuration
* **Signal-Based Communication**: Loose coupling between components using PyQt signals
* **Persistent Configuration**: User settings and preferences saved between sessions
* **Extensible Model System**: Easy integration of new SAM models and types

For detailed technical documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](src/lazylabel/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ‚å®Ô∏è Hotkey Customization

LazyLabel includes a comprehensive hotkey management system:

* **Full Customization**: Personalize keyboard shortcuts for all 27+ functions
* **Category Organization**: Hotkeys organized by function (Modes, Actions, Navigation, etc.)
* **Primary & Secondary Keys**: Set multiple shortcuts for the same action
* **Persistent Settings**: Custom hotkeys saved between sessions
* **Conflict Prevention**: System prevents duplicate key assignments

For complete hotkey documentation, see [HOTKEY_FEATURE.md](src/lazylabel/HOTKEY_FEATURE.md).

## Development

### Code Quality
This project uses Ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
& e:\venv\lazylabel\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run linter
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .

# Check if code is properly formatted
ruff format --check .
```

### Testing

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=lazylabel --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/ui/test_undo_redo.py -v
```

The HTML coverage report will be generated in `htmlcov/` directory.
