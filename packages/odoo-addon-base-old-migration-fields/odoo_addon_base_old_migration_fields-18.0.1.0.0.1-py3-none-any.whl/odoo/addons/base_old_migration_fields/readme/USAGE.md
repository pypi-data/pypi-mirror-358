You’ll need to install additional modules (like the ones mentioned above) that actually add the fields for old IDs.

This base module just makes sure access to those fields is restricted to the right users.

There’s no menu or interface — it just works in the background to manage access.

Some common use cases:

* Linking imported records with their original IDs.
* Updating data after a migration.
* Keeping a reference to old systems for audits or syncing
