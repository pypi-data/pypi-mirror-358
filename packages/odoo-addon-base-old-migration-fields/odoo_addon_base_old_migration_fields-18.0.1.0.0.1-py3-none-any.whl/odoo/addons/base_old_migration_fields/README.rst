This module helps during data migrations between Odoo versions or from
other systems by allowing you to keep the original IDs from the old
database. These IDs can be useful later to match or update records.

The module creates a group called Old Migration Fields Manager. Only
users in this group can see or edit the "old ID" fields that are added
by other modules like:

- partner_contact_old_migration_fields
- product_old_migration_fields

This module by itself doesn’t add any fields — it just provides the
access control.

Usage
=====

You’ll need to install additional modules (like the ones mentioned
above) that actually add the fields for old IDs.

This base module just makes sure access to those fields is restricted to
the right users.

There’s no menu or interface — it just works in the background to manage
access.

Some common use cases:

- Linking imported records with their original IDs.
- Updating data after a migration.
- Keeping a reference to old systems for audits or syncing
