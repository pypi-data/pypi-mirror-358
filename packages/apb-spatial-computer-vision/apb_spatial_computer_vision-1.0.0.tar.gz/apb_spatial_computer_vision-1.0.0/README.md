# TFG
This repository hosts the code for my Bachelors' thesis in Geoinfomation and Geomatics Engineering.
The project has been tutored by Port de Barcelona and Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

# About this package
The goal of APB_spatial_computer_vision is to provide a framework to perform computer vision tasks on geospatial imagery.
Its focus is semantic segmentation, mainly though SAM. The logic can be accessed in several points: 

- Through text, to perform image to bbox tasks via Grounding DINO.
- Through bounding box, to perform SAM and achieve segmentation.
- Throgh a lower resolution vector dataset coming from another model, in an attempt to improve segmentation.

# Tools
- ü¶Ü The program leverages Spatial-SQL **DuckDB** queries for precise vector operations
- ‚ö° Image pyramids have been optimized via concurrency to GDAL-warping
- üì∑ Integration of virtual layers through GDAL to SAMGeo
- üìÑ MKDocs for automated docs+ jupyter visualization

# Instructions
The entry points of the system are the following environment variables:
- TEXT_PROMPT: a string with the prompt to look for via Grounding DINO
- VECTOR_DATASET: a vector dataset
- DATA_DIR: location of the data
- BASE_DIR: where this package is located, acessible for deployments
- NAME_ORTOFOTO: basename for the image to be processed
