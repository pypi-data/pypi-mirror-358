# Purpose

Performs global sequence alignment of two strings.  Allows for affine gap penalties.

# Installation

The package can be installed via `pip`, `conda`, or `mamba`.

## pip

Run the following in a terminal.

```bash
python3 -m venv my_venv_for_globalign
source my_venv_for_globalign/bin/activate
pip install globalign
```

## conda

We recommend using mamba, but conda works too.  Be careful not to install into your base environment.  Here, we create and activate an evironment first.  For more information on using conda to install packages, refer to the [documentation](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/working-with-conda/packages/install-packages#using-the-channel-flag).  Run the following in a terminal.

```bash
conda create -n globalign_conda_test
conda activate globalign_conda_test
conda install --channel conda-forge globalign
```

## [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)

A drop-in replacement for conda:

```bash
mamba create -n globalign_conda_test
mamba activate globalign_conda_test
mamba install --channel conda-forge globalign
```

# Contributing

You will need to install [quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/) to be able to publish documentation updates.  To build the documentation locally and publish it to GitHub, do the following: From the project root, run:

```bash
quartodoc build
quarto render
```

If you are happy with the resulting website, then push your changes to a branch other than `gh-pages`.  Then, (from a branch other than `gh-pages`), execute the command:

```bash
quarto publish gh-pages
```

The public-facing website should now be updated.

To run unit tests, make sure [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) are installed and available.  Building also requires the [hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs) plugin.  To build and test, do the following: From the project root, run:

```bash
rm -rf dist/
hatch build
hatch test
```

To install from source, run the following from the project root after building:

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

Versions can be changed via git tags.  For example, run this with the version you want:

```bash
git tag -a "v0.0.0"
git push origin v0.0.0
```

A special thanks goes to Mykola Akulov and Ragnar Groot Koerkamp for their insightful [blog post](https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/alignment-scores-transform/) without which I would not have known how to make this package work with both scoring and costing schemes.
