# SSVC Ore Miner

## **Overview**
The **Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) Ore Miner** is a tool designed to enhance vulnerability management by automating the process of calculating patch priority. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional methods like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) by incorporating asset context and vulnerability intelligence.

### **Why SSVC Ore Miner?**
While CVSS provides a generic risk score, it fails to consider the specific context of vulnerable assets. SSVC Ore Miner bridges this gap by:
- Accounting for the real-life implications of vulnerabilities.
- Using well-defined decision logic for prioritization.
- Allowing inspection, modification, and extension of decision criteria to fit organizational needs.
- **NEW**: Integrating EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) scores for enhanced risk assessment.
- **NEW**: Providing descriptive risk language explaining decisions in simple terms.

By leveraging asset context and vulnerability intelligence, the SSVC Ore Miner helps security teams focus on vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk of compromise.

---

## **Installation**

```bash
pip install rapticoressvc
```

After installation, you can use the tool in two ways:

### **1. Console Script (Recommended)**
The package installs a `ssvc-ore` command that you can use directly:
```bash
ssvc-ore --help
```

### **2. Python Module**
You can also run it as a Python module:
```bash
python -m rapticoressvc.ssvc_ore --help
```

---

## **Prioritization Criteria**

SSVC Ore Miner evaluates vulnerabilities using the following vectors:

1. **Exploitation:**  
   Determines the exploit's availability and status using open-source threat intelligence feeds.  
   - Possible values: `active`, `PoC`, `none`

2. **Exposure:**  
   Assesses the likelihood of exposure if an exploit is used against a vulnerable asset.  
   - Possible values: `unavoidable`, `probable`, `unlikely`

3. **Utility:**  
   Evaluates the ease of exploitation based on factors like network access, user interaction, and asset discoverability.  
   - Possible values: `effortless`, `complex`, `laborious`

4. **Impact:**  
   Considers the environment (e.g., production or staging), asset type, and criticality to the business.  
   - Possible values: `very high`, `high`, `medium`, `low`

5. **EPSS Score:**  
   **NEW**: Exploit Prediction Scoring System score indicating the probability of exploitation within 30 days.
   - Provides percentile ranking and risk categorization

---

## **Patch Priority Levels**
Based on the evaluation, SSVC Ore Miner assigns one of the following patch priorities:

| Patch Priority  | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **act_now**      | Critical risk of compromise. The vulnerability affects a public-facing or critical asset, and the exploit is highly effective.             |
| **out-of-cycle** | Increased risk of compromise. Patching should occur ahead of the regular schedule.                                                          |
| **schedule**     | Follow the regular patching schedule.                                                                                                      |
| **defer**        | The risk is minimal; the patch can be delayed.                                                                                             |
| **review**       | The vulnerability is new or undisclosed, and a CVSS vector has not been assigned yet. Requires further analysis.                           |

## **Usage**

### **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

```bash
ssvc-ore [-h] [--single | --datafile] [-cn CVE_NUMBER] [-p {public,public_restricted,private,None}] 
          [-e {production,non_production,None}] [-a {db,compute,storage,None,network}] 
          [-s {critical,high,medium,low}] [--file FILE] [-v]
```

#### **Optional Arguments**:
- `-h, --help`: Show help message.
- `--single`: Parameter-based entry.
- `--datafile`: Upload vulnerabilities via a CSV file using `--file`.
- `-id, --asset_id`: Asset identifier (optional).
- `-cn, --cve_number`: CVE numbers separated by `|`.
- `-p, --public_status`: Public status of the asset (`public`, `public_restricted`, `private`, `none`).
- `-vs, --vul_severity`: Vulnerability severity (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`).
- `-e, --environment`: Asset environment (`production`, `non_production`, `none`).
- `-a, --assetType`: Asset type (`db`, `compute`, `storage`, `network`, `none`).
- `-s, --criticality`: Business criticality of the asset (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`).
- `--file`: Provide a CSV file for batch vulnerability input.
- `-v, --verbose`: Increase output verbosity.

### **Example Usage**

#### **Single Vulnerability Analysis**
```bash
ssvc-ore --single -id "web-server-01" -cn "CVE-2023-1234" -p "public" -e "production" -a "compute" -s "high" -v
```

#### **Batch Processing with CSV File**
```bash
ssvc-ore --datafile --file vulnerabilities.csv -v
```

#### **Using Severity Instead of CVE**
```bash
ssvc-ore --single -id "database-01" -vs "critical" -p "private" -e "production" -a "db" -s "critical" -v
```

### **CSV File Format**
Your CSV file should have the following columns:
```csv
asset_id,cve_number,vul_severity,public_status,environment,assetType,assetCriticality
web-server-01,CVE-2023-1234|CVE-2023-5678,None,public,production,compute,high
database-01,None,critical,private,production,db,critical
```

---

### **Use as a Python Package**

```python
from rapticoressvc.ssvc_ore import ssvc_recommendations

# Analyze a single vulnerability
result = ssvc_recommendations(
    asset="web-server-01",
    vul_details=["CVE-2023-1234"],
    public_status="public",
    environment="production",
    asset_type="compute",
    asset_criticality="high"
)

print(f"SSVC Recommendation: {result['ssvc_rec']}")
print(f"Risk Description: {result['risk_description']}")
print(f"EPSS Score: {result['epss_score']}")
```
