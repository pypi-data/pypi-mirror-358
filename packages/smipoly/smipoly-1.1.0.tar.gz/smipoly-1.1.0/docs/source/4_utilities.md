# 4. utilities; Overview

.ipynb files in directiry "utirities" are tools to imprementing the rules of monomer extraction-cllasification , polymerization reaction definition and polymer generation.  

By using the files in './utilities' directory, one can modify or add the definition of monomers, the rules of polymerization reactions and polymer classes.  
To apply the new rule(s), replace the old './smipoly/rules' directory by the new one. The files must be run according to the number assigned the head of the each filename.  

  - 1_MonomerDefiner.ipynb: definitions of monomers  
  - 2_Ps_rxnL.ipynb: rules of polymerization reactions    
  - 3_Ps_GenL.ipynb: definitions of polymer classes with combinations of starting monomer(s) and polymerization reaction  

Each definations were written by [SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smarts/)) strings.  

The difined monomer classificatin, polymerization reaction and the polymer genration rules were located in src/smipoly/rulse as pickle or json file.  
These were genarated by using utilities/1_MonomerDefiner.ipynb, 2_Ps_rxnL.ipynb and 3_Ps_GenL.ipynb.
