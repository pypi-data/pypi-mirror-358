edc-pdf-reports
---------------

Reportlab/PDF classes for clinicedc/edc projects

Overview
========

This module offers functionality to link a PDF report to a model registered with ModelAdmin.

The ``CrfPdfReport`` class links a PDF report to a model registered with ModelAdmin. A link as is added
to the changelist that opens an intermediate page to ask for a password. From the intermediate page
a secure file is downloaded into the browser. See also ``PdfIntermediateView`` and ``PrintPdfReportView``.

For this to work, you need to:

* create a pdf report class;
* declare the model with the ``PdfReportModelMixin`` and set the ``pdf_report_cls`` attr on the model;
* declare the model's ModelAdmin class with ``PdfButtonModelAdminMixin``;
* add ``print_to_pdf_action`` to Modeladmin.actions (required to print one or more pdfs using actions);
* add "pdf_button" to the list_display (required for pdf button to appear on each row);
* update your app's urls;
* add edc_pdf_reports to INSTALLED_APPS.

Your changelist will include options for printing one or many PDF reports into a
password protected and secure PDF file.

If you are using this module outside of a clinicedc/edc project, you need to update two
``settings`` attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    # tells edc_pdf_reports to not import two clinicedc modules
    EDC_PDF_REPORTS_INTEGRATE_EDC = False
    # points
    EDC_PDF_REPORTS_TEMPLATES = {"pdf_intermediate": "edc_pdf_reports/generic_pdf_intermediate.html"}




DeathReport as an example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

``edc_adverse_event`` has this configured for its ``DeathReport`` model. Let's use this as an example.

Create the ``DeathReport`` model:

.. code-block:: python

    # models.py

    class DeathReport(PdfReportModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):

        pdf_report_cls = DeathPdfReport


Create the ``DeathPdfReport`` class. ``DeathPdfReport`` inherits from  ``CrfPdfReport``. Link the ``model`` and
`changelist_url`` to this PDF report class.

.. code-block:: python

    # death_pdf_report.py

    class DeathPdfReport(CrfPdfReport):
        model = f"{get_adverse_event_app_label()}.deathreport"
        changelist_url = (
            f"{get_adverse_event_app_label()}_admin:{get_adverse_event_app_label()}_"
            "deathreport_changelist"
        )

        def get_report_story(self, **kwargs):
            ...

Declare the ModelAdmin class with ``PdfButtonModelAdminMixin``:

.. code-block:: python

    # admin.py

    @admin.action(permissions=["view"], description="Print Death Reports as PDF")
    def print_to_pdf_action(modeladmin, request, queryset):
        return print_selected_to_pdf_action(modeladmin, request, queryset)


    class DeathReportModelAdmin(PdfButtonModelAdminMixin, DeathReportModelAdminMixin):
        actions = [print_to_pdf_action]
        list_display = ["subject_identifier", "pdf_button", ...]


Update your url patterns:

.. code-block:: python

    # urls.py
    url_patterns = [
        ...,
        *paths_for_urlpatterns("edc_pdf_reports"),
        ...]


Add to ``settings``:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "edc_pdf_reports.apps.AppConfig"
        ...]


Your changelist will have the new column "PDF" and the print as pdf action will be available.

|changelist|

The intermediate page, linked from the changelist, will look like this:

|intermediate_page|

Note the passphrase and click "Create File". The file will be created in the view and downloaded by the browser.

Creating a PDF file outside of the view
=======================================

The view ``PrintPdfReportView`` uses function ``write_queryset_to_secure_pdf`` to create a PDF.
You can access this function directly.

For example:

.. code-block:: python


    import mempass
    import tempfile
    from pathlib import Path
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from edc_pdf_reports.utils import write_queryset_to_secure_pdf, write_model_to_insecure_pdf
    from effect_ae.models import DeathReport

    dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    p = Path(dir)
    qs = DeathReport.objects.all()
    user = User.objects.get(username="erikvw")

    # create a secure PDF file for the queryset
    q = p / "death_reports_secure.pdf"
    password = mempass.mkpassword(2)
    buffer = write_queryset_to_secure_pdf(queryset=qs, password=password, user=user)
    q.write_bytes(buffer.getbuffer())
    print(q)

    # create an insecure PDF file for one model instance
    q = p / "death_reports_insecure.pdf"
    model_obj = qs[0]
    buffer = write_model_to_insecure_pdf(model_obj, user=user)
    q.write_bytes(buffer.getbuffer())
    print(q)

Add watermark to report
=======================

When testing, you can add a watermark to the report. In your test settings set the following:

.. code-block:: python

    EDC_PDF_REPORTS_WATERMARK_WORD = "SAMPLE"
    EDC_PDF_REPORTS_WATERMARK_FONT = ("Helvetica", 100)

The watermark prints at a 45 degree rotation across the center of each page.
