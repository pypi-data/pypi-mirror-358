to load the [Dakota](https://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota) 
python module.

```
pip install itis-dakota
```

Requirements
------------

At the moment the wheel can be installed on **Linux** ([manylinux_2_28](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) compatible distributions) only.

Support for other operating systems will be added in the future.

Using the wheel
------------------

After installation, the module can be imported:
```
import dakota
import dakota.environment as dakenv
```

And example on how to use the environment module can be found here:
