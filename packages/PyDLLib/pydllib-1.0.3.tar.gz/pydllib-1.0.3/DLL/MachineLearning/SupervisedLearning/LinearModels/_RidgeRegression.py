class RidgeRegression:
    """
    Implements a linear regression model with L2 regularization.
    
    Args:
        alpha (int | float, optional): The regularization parameter. Larger alpha will force the l2 norm of the weights to be lower. Must be a positive real number. Defaults to 1.

    Attributes:
        n_features (int): The number of features. Available after fitting.
        beta (torch.Tensor of shape (n_features + 1,)): The weights of the linear regression model. Available after fitting.
        residuals (torch.Tensor of shape (n_samples,)): The residuals of the fitted model. For a good fit, the residuals should be normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance. Available after fitting.
