Summary: DFUai is a Python package that uses AI to assist clinical doctors in diagnosing the severity of diabetic foot ulcers. It classifies diabetic foot severity (mild, moderate, or severe) based on eight clinical features: PAD, CRP, HbA1c, DKD, ESR, ALB, SBP, and X25OHD.

Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

DFUai is a Python package that utilizes AI to assist clinicians in diagnosing the severity of diabetic foot (DF). By simply inputting a file with the grouped information of eight clinical features (PAD, CRP, HbA1c, DKD, ESR, ALB, SBP, and X25OHD), DFUai predicts whether the diabetic foot condition is mild/moderate or severe.

Feature Grouping Criteria:

PAD (Peripheral Artery Disease): Grouped according to clinical guidelines.
DKD (Diabetic Kidney Disease): Grouped based on clinical guidelines.
CRP (C-Reactive Protein): Grouped as 1 if greater than 16.34 mg/L, otherwise 0.
ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate): Grouped as 1 if greater than 44.5 mm/h, otherwise 0.
ALB (Albumin): Grouped as 1 if greater than 41.55 g/L, otherwise 0.
SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure): Grouped as 1 if greater than 136.5 mmHg, otherwise 0.
X25OHD (25-Hydroxyvitamin D): Grouped as 1 if greater than 12.945 ng/mL, otherwise 0.
HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin): Grouped as 1 if greater than 8.05%, otherwise 0.
The input format has rows as sample names, columns as variable feature names, and the cells filled with the grouped information of the variable features.
