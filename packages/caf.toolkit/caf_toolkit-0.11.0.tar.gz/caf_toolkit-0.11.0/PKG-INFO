The Common Analytical Framework (CAF) Toolkit is a toolkit of transport
planning and appraisal functionalities. It's the beginning of a project to make
a lot of the useful stuff from
[NorMITs Demand](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand)
more widely available and easily accessible.

## Common Analytical Framework

This package is sits within the [Common Analytical Framework (CAF)](https://transport-for-the-north.github.io/caf_homepage/intro.html),
which is a collaboration between transport bodies in the UK to develop and maintain commonly used
transport analytics and appraisal tools.
