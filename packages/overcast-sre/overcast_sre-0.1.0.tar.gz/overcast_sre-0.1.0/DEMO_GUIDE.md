## üöÄ STEP 1: CUSTOMER SETUP

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Let me show you how quick it is to get started with Overcast. First, we'll set up your account and get your monitoring key."*

### Steps to follow:

**1.1** Open a terminal/command prompt on your demo machine

**1.2** Navigate to the SDK folder:
```bash
cd sdk
```

**1.3** Tell the customer: *"Every customer gets a unique API key for security. This is how we identify your data."*

**1.4** Show them the customer is already configured in our demo:
- API Key: `demo-customer-123`  
- Company Name: `Demo E-commerce Store`

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **Simple onboarding** - No complex setup required  
‚úÖ **Secure** - Each customer has their own isolated data  
‚úÖ **Ready in seconds** - Not hours or days like other tools

## üîß STEP 2: SDK INTEGRATION

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Now I'll show you how your developers would add Overcast monitoring to your application. It's just 3 lines of code."*

### Steps to follow:

**2.1** Open the demo app file to show the integration:
```bash
# Show them the file (don't run yet)
cat demo_app.py
```

**2.2** Point out the key integration parts:
```python
# 1. Import the SDK
import __init__ as overcast

# 2. Initialize monitoring (1 line)
overcast.init(
    api_key="demo-customer-123",
    customer_name="Demo E-commerce Store"
)

# 3. Add monitoring to your code (1 line each)
overcast.log("Order processed", level="INFO", service="orders")
overcast.metric("response_time", 1.2, service="api")
overcast.alert("Payment failed", severity="high", service="payments")
```

**2.3** Explain the business context:
*"This is a mock e-commerce application - just like what your company might have. It processes orders, handles payments, manages inventory, and tracks analytics."*

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **Easy integration** - 3 lines of code, not weeks of setup  
‚úÖ **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't change existing business logic  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive** - Logs, metrics, and alerts in one place

## üìä STEP 3: START THE MONITORING DASHBOARD

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Before we run your application, let's start the monitoring dashboard so you can see everything in real-time."*

### Steps to follow:

**3.1** Start the dashboard server:
```bash
python server.py
```

**3.2** Wait for this message:
```
üåê Starting Overcast dashboard on http://0.0.0.0:5000
ü§ñ Background processing agent started
‚úÖ Dashboard server started successfully!
```

**3.3** Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

**3.4** Show the customer the empty dashboard:
*"Right now it's empty because your application isn't running yet. Let's change that."*

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **Real-time visibility** - See everything as it happens  
‚úÖ **Professional interface** - Clean, executive-friendly dashboard  
‚úÖ **Always-on monitoring** - Background agent processes everything automatically

---

## üõçÔ∏è STEP 4: RUN THE APPLICATION (NORMAL MODE)

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Let's start with normal operations to show you how Overcast monitors your healthy application."*

### Steps to follow:

**4.1** Open a new terminal/command prompt (keep the dashboard running)

**4.2** Navigate to SDK folder:
```bash
cd sdk
```

**4.3** Start the demo application:
```bash
python demo_app.py
```

**4.4** When prompted, select: `1` (Normal operations)

**4.5** Let it run for 2-3 cycles, then show the customer the dashboard:
- Refresh the browser at `http://localhost:5000`
- Point out the **Services** appearing (order-service, payment-service, etc.)
- Show the **Metrics** being collected
- Show the **Recent Logs** appearing

**4.6** Stop the app with `Ctrl+C`

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **Automatic discovery** - Services appear automatically  
‚úÖ **Rich data collection** - Logs, metrics, business KPIs  
‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box

## üö® STEP 5: TRIGGER FAILURES & INCIDENTS

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Now let me show you the real power of Overcast - what happens when things go wrong in production."*

### Steps to follow:

**5.1** Restart the demo application:
```bash
python demo_app.py
```

**5.2** This time select: `2` (Failure simulation)

**5.3** You'll see this message:
```
üî¥ FAILURE MODE ENABLED - Incidents will be triggered!
```

**5.4** Let the application run and watch for failures:
- You'll see **RED** error messages in the terminal
- Critical failures like: *"CRITICAL: Payment system failure"*
- Database issues: *"Database connection pool exhausted"*

**5.5** Switch to the dashboard and refresh:
- Point out the **Incidents** section at the top
- Show the **High severity scores** (red numbers like 9.0/10)
- Point to **Recent Incidents** showing critical failures

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **Automatic incident detection** - No manual configuration needed  
‚úÖ **Intelligent prioritization** - Critical issues scored higher  
‚úÖ **Real business impact** - Payment failures, not just server metrics

## ü§ñ STEP 6: AI ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"Here's where Overcast's AI really shines - it automatically analyzes every incident and provides actionable insights."*

### Steps to follow:

**6.1** In the dashboard, look for the **Recent Incidents** section

**6.2** Click on any incident row to **expand** it (look for arrows or plus signs)

**6.3** Point out the AI analysis sections:

**üéØ Root Cause Analysis:**
- *"Payment gateway connection timeout due to network latency issues"*
- *"Database connection pool exhausted due to query bottleneck"*

**üí• Impact Assessment:**  
- *"Critical business impact: 40% of customer transactions failing"*
- *"Revenue loss estimated at $2,400/hour based on transaction volume"*

**üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Steps:**
1. *"Restart payment gateway connection pool"*
2. *"Scale database read replicas"*  
3. *"Contact Stripe support for gateway status"*

**üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures:**
1. *"Implement circuit breaker pattern for payment calls"*
2. *"Add database connection monitoring alerts"*
3. *"Set up automated failover for payment gateway"*

**6.4** Show the **Timeline** of events leading to the incident

### What this demonstrates:
‚úÖ **AI-powered insights** - Not just alerts, but actual solutions  
‚úÖ **Business context** - Revenue impact, not just technical metrics  
‚úÖ **Actionable guidance** - Your team knows exactly what to do  
‚úÖ **Learning system** - Gets smarter with each incident

---

## üéâ STEP 7: WRAP UP THE DEMO

### What you'll tell the customer:
*"In just 10 minutes, we've shown you how Overcast transforms your incident response from reactive firefighting to proactive problem-solving."*

### Key points to emphasize:

**Before Overcast:**
- ‚ùå Incidents discovered by customers calling
- ‚ùå Hours spent figuring out what went wrong  
- ‚ùå Guessing at solutions, hoping they work
- ‚ùå Same problems keep happening

**After Overcast:**
- ‚úÖ Incidents detected automatically in seconds
- ‚úÖ AI provides root cause analysis immediately
- ‚úÖ Clear resolution steps prevent guessing
- ‚úÖ Prevention measures stop repeat incidents

### Next Steps:
1. **"Would you like to see this running on your actual application?"**
2. **"I can have our team set up a pilot with your dev team this week"**  
3. **"What questions do you have about getting started?"**

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If the dashboard doesn't load:
- Make sure `python server.py` is running
- Try `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead of localhost
- Check that port 5000 isn't blocked

### If no incidents appear:
- Make sure you selected option `2` (Failure simulation)
- Let the app run for at least 3-4 cycles
- Refresh the dashboard browser page

### If AI analysis is missing:
- Make sure OpenAI API key is configured
- Wait 30 seconds after incidents appear
- Check for any error messages in the server terminal
