## 🔧 TECHNICAL SETUP

### Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection (for AI analysis)
- Web browser

### If Something Goes Wrong:

**Dashboard won't load:**
- Make sure no other app is using port 5000
- Try http://127.0.0.1:5000 instead

**No incidents appear:**
- Make sure you selected option "2" (failure mode)
- Wait 2-3 cycles for failures to trigger
- Refresh dashboard page

**AI analysis missing:**
- Check internet connection
- Wait 30 seconds after incidents appear
- AI processing takes a few moments

## 📞 FOR CUSTOMER FOLLOW-UPS

After the demo, give customers:
- **QUICK_START.md** - Shows them how to integrate
- Your contact info for technical setup
- Timeline for pilot implementation

Typical next steps:
1. Customer tries the demo themselves
2. Technical discussion with their dev team
