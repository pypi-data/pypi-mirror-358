# Layman Terminal

This project aims to reduce the effort of searching the internet or using tools like ChatGPT to find terminal commands, copying them, editing them as per your requirements, and then running them in the terminal. What if we gave you the ability to write a command in natural language, and an agent would convert it into a terminal command and execute it for you? 

Now, you might say, "Existing tools like Copilot already do this." But I don't want to use those tools. I prefer not to give direct access to my laptop to such tools, and honestly, it's fun to create a tool that does exactly what these billion-dollar companies doâ€”without compromising user data or requiring a subscription. 

Use this project at your own risk. I will try to maintain it on my end, but I can't guarantee anything. I started this as a fun project to help with my day-to-day tasks, and I'm not sure how far I will take it. Feel free to use it and go crazy with it.
