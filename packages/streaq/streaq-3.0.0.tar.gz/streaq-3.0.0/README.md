# streaQ

Fast, async, type-safe distributed task queue for Redis

## Features

- Up to [5x-15x faster](https://github.com/tastyware/streaq/tree/master/benchmarks) than arq
- Strongly typed
- 95%+ unit test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation
- Support for delayed/scheduled tasks
- Cron jobs
- Task middleware
- Task dependency graph
- Pipelining
- Priority queues
- Support for synchronous tasks (run in separate threads)
- Dead simple, ~2k lines of code
- Redis Sentinel support for production

## Installation

```console
$ pip install streaq
```

## Getting started

To start, you'll need to create a `Worker` object:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import AsyncIterator
from httpx import AsyncClient
from streaq import Worker

@dataclass
class WorkerContext:
    """
    Type safe way of defining the dependencies of your tasks.
    e.g. HTTP client, database connection, settings.
    """
    http_client: AsyncClient

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(worker: Worker[WorkerContext]) -> AsyncIterator[WorkerContext]:
    """
    Here, we initialize the worker's dependencies.
    You can also do any startup/shutdown work here!
    """
    async with AsyncClient() as http_client:
        yield Context(http_client)

worker = Worker(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379", lifespan=lifespan)
```

You can then register async tasks with the worker like this:

```python
@worker.task(timeout=5)
async def fetch(url: str) -> int:
    # worker.context here is of type WorkerContext, enforced by static typing
    res = await worker.context.http_client.get(url)
    return len(res.text)

@worker.cron("* * * * mon-fri")  # every minute on weekdays
async def cronjob() -> None:
    print("It's a bird... It's a plane... It's CRON!")
```

Finally, use the worker's async context manager to queue up tasks:

```python
async with worker:
    await fetch.enqueue("https://tastyware.dev/")
    # this will be run directly locally, not enqueued
    await fetch.run("https://github.com/python-arq/arq")
    # enqueue returns a task object that can be used to get results/info
    task = await fetch.enqueue("https://github.com/tastyware/streaq").start(delay=3)
    print(await task.info())
    print(await task.result(timeout=5))
```

Putting this all together gives us [example.py](https://github.com/tastyware/streaq/blob/master/example.py). Let's spin up a worker:
```
$ streaq example.worker
```
and queue up some tasks like so:
```
$ python example.py
```

Let's see what the output looks like:

```
