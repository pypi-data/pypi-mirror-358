# Async Python

## Introduction

Modern web applications demand concurrency — the ability to handle thousands of tasks at the same time. Traditionally, Python's synchronous, blocking nature made this difficult. But with the advent of `asyncio`, Python now supports **asynchronous programming**, enabling it to handle I/O-bound tasks far more efficiently.

This guide dives deep into how asynchronous Python works, why it's necessary, and how to write scalable, non-blocking code using `async` and `await`.

## The Problem with Synchronous Code

Python executes one line at a time. When it hits a long-running operation like a database query or an HTTP request, the whole program stops and waits. That’s fine for scripts or small apps, but inefficient in systems that require concurrency — like servers or data pipelines.

### Example:

```python
import requests

def fetch_data():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com")
    return response.json()

data = fetch_data()
print(data)
```

This will block until the network request completes. During that time, Python cannot do anything else — no other tasks, no serving other users.

Now imagine you're building a server that needs to serve 500 clients simultaneously. Blocking each call like this would kill performance.

---

## What Async Solves

Async Python doesn't use threads to solve this — it uses something called the **event loop**, which lets Python switch between multiple "tasks" during I/O waits.

This model is useful when your code spends a lot of time **waiting** — for HTTP responses, file reads, database queries, etc.

---

## Sync vs Async

Let’s illustrate the difference with a simple diagram.

### Synchronous Execution

```
Task A: [==== wait 3s ====]
Task B:                  [==== wait 3s ====]
Total Time: 6s
```

### Asynchronous Execution

```
Task A: [== initiated ==]     [== continues ==]
Task B:       [== starts ==]     [== finishes ==]
Total Time: ~3s
```

In async mode, while Task A is waiting (e.g. for a network response), Task B runs. We achieve **concurrency**, not through threads, but via **non-blocking I/O**.

## Core Concepts of Async Python

### 1. Coroutines

A coroutine is a function defined with `async def`. It's not executed immediately — instead, it returns a coroutine object. You need to **await** it.

```python
async def my_coroutine():
    print("Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("End")
```

### 2. The Event Loop

The event loop runs in the background, managing coroutines and deciding when to pause or resume them.

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    await my_coroutine()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 3. Awaitables

An object is *awaitable* if it can be used with the `await` keyword. These include:

* Coroutines
* Tasks (created with `asyncio.create_task`)
* Futures

---

## Practical Example: Concurrent Tasks

Let’s simulate a blocking API with async.

```python
import asyncio

async def get_data(x):
    print(f"Fetching {x}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Result {x}"

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(get_data(1))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(get_data(2))
    result1 = await task1
    result2 = await task2
    print(result1, result2)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**

```
Fetching 1
Fetching 2
Result 1 Result 2
```

Even though both tasks wait 2 seconds, they run *concurrently*. So total time ≈ 2 seconds instead of 4.

---

## More Async Tools in Python

### `asyncio.gather()`

Runs multiple coroutines in parallel and returns their results.

```python
results = await asyncio.gather(get_data(1), get_data(2), get_data(3))
```

### `asyncio.sleep()`

An async version of `time.sleep()`. It simulates delay without blocking the event loop.

---

## Mixing Async and Sync Code

You **cannot** use `await` in a regular (non-async) function.

```python
def wrong():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # SyntaxError
```

Always wrap your async code in an `async def` and use `await` inside it.

---

## Real-World Applications

1. **Web frameworks**: FastAPI, Nexios, Sanic — all use async to handle thousands of HTTP requests concurrently.
2. **WebSocket servers**: Real-time systems like chat, stock dashboards.
3. **Web scraping**: Using `aiohttp` and `asyncio.gather()` to fetch many pages in parallel.
4. **Task pipelines**: Running I/O-heavy tasks concurrently.

---

## When Async is NOT Helpful

Async is **not** helpful when:

* Your code is CPU-bound (e.g., image processing, machine learning). Use multiprocessing or native threads for that.
* You have complex call stacks that become hard to reason about.
* You're dealing with libraries that don't support `asyncio`.

## Comparison: Threads vs Async

| Feature           | Threads         | Asyncio (Async/Await)    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Concurrency model | Pre-emptive     | Cooperative (event loop) |
| Memory usage      | Higher          | Lower                    |
| Complexity        | Medium          | Low to Medium            |
| Best for          | CPU-bound tasks | I/O-bound tasks          |

## Final Thoughts

Async Python is powerful but comes with a different mindset. If you’re building high-performance servers (like Nexios), learning async is not just useful — it’s essential.

Focus on mastering:

* `async def` and `await`
* `asyncio.run`, `asyncio.create_task`, `asyncio.gather`
* Writing non-blocking logic

Once you internalize this pattern, you'll build faster, more efficient systems — the kind of work that scales under load and feels snappy to users.

Let me know if you want the same broken down for Nexios’s core — like how to use async in routing or middleware.
