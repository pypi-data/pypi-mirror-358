## Quick Start Workflows

### Basic USDZ Creation
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge usd-core
pip install trimesh pillow

# 2. Create simple USDZ
python create_basic_usdz.py input_texture.png output.usdz

# 3. Validate for AR
usdchecker --arkit output.usdz
```

### AR Sticker Pipeline
```bash
# Complete sticker creation workflow
python ar_sticker_pipeline.py \
  --input image.jpg \
  --output ar_sticker.usdz \
  --scale 0.15 \
  --optimize-mobile
```

### Web Deployment
```html
<!-- Universal AR viewer -->
<model-viewer 
  src="model.gltf"
  ios-src="model.usdz"
  ar auto-rotate camera-controls>
</model-viewer>
```
