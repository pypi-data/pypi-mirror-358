class JSONGrapherRecord:
    """
    This class enables making JSONGrapher records. Each instance represents a structured JSON record for a graph.
    One can optionally provide an existing JSONGrapher record during creation to pre-populate the object.
    One can manipulate the fig_dict inside, directly, using syntax like Record.fig_dict["comments"] = ...
    One can also use syntax like Record["comments"] = ...  as some 'magic' synchronizes fields directlyin the Record with fields in the fig_dict.
    However, developers should usually use the syntax like Record.fig_dict, internally, to avoid any referencing mistakes.


    Arguments & Attributes (all are optional):
        comments (str): Can be used to put in general description or metadata related to the entire record. Can include citation links. Goes into the record's top level comments field.
        datatype: The datatype is the experiment type or similar, it is used to assess which records can be compared and which (if any) schema to compare to. Use of single underscores between words is recommended. This ends up being the datatype field of the full JSONGrapher file. Avoid using double underscores '__' in this field  unless you have read the manual about hierarchical datatypes. The user can choose to provide a URL to a schema in this field, rather than a dataype name.
        graph_title: Title of the graph or the dataset being represented.
        data_objects_list (list): List of data series dictionaries to pre-populate the record. These may contain 'simulate' fields in them to call javascript source code for simulating on the fly.
        simulate_as_added: Boolean. True by default. If true, any data series that are added with a simulation field will have an immediate simulation call attempt.
        x_data: Single series x data in a list or array-like structure. 
        y_data: Single series y data in a list or array-like structure.
        x_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units . The dimensions of units can be multiple, such as mol/s. SI units are expected. Custom units must be inside  < > and at the beginning.  For example, (<frogs>*kg/s)  would be permissible. Units should be non-plural (kg instead of kgs) and should be abbreviated (m not meter). Use “^” for exponents. It is recommended to have no numbers in the units other than exponents, and to thus use (bar)^(-1) rather than 1/bar.
        y_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units . The dimensions of units can be multiple, such as mol/s. SI units are expected. Custom units must be inside  < > and at the beginning.  For example, (<frogs>*kg/s)  would be permissible. Units should be non-plural (kg instead of kgs) and should be abbreviated (m not meter). Use “^” for exponents. It is recommended to have no numbers in the units other than exponents, and to thus use (bar)^(-1) rather than 1/bar.
        layout: A dictionary defining the layout of the graph, including axis titles,
                comments, and general formatting options.
    
    Methods:
        add_data_series: Adds a new data series to the record.
        add_data_series_as_equation: Adds a new equation to plot, which will be evaluated on the fly.
        set_layout_fields: Updates the layout configuration for the graph.
        export_to_json_file: Saves the entire record (comments, datatype, data, layout) as a JSON file.

## Start of Section of Code for Styles and Converting between plotly and matplotlib Fig objectss ##
# #There are a few things to know about the styles logic of JSONGrapher:
# (1) There are actually two parts to the plot_style: a layout_style for the graph and a trace_styles_collection which will get applied to the individual dataseries.
#    So the plot_style is really supposed to be a dictionary with {"layout_style":"default", "trace_styles_collection":"default"} that way it is JSON compatible and avoids ambiguity. 
#    A person can pass in dictionaries for layout_style and for trace_styles_collection and thereby create custom styles.
#    There are helper functions to extract style dictionaries once a person has a JSONGrapher record which they're happy with.
# (2) We parse what the person provides as a style, so we accept things other than the ideal plot_style dictionary format.  
#    If someone provides a single string, we'll use it for both layout_style and trace_styles_collection.
#    If we get a list of two, we'll expect that to be in the order of layout_style then trace_styles_collection
#    If we get a string that we can't find in the existing styles list, then we'll use the default. 
# (1) by default, exporting a JSONGRapher record to file will *not* include plot_styles.  include_formatting will be an optional argument. 
# (2) There is an apply_plot_style function which will first put the style into self.fig_dict['plot_style'] so it stays there, before applying the style.
# (3) For the plotting functions, they will have plot_style = {"layout_style":"", "trace_styles_collection":""} or = '' as their default argument value, which will result in checking if plot_style exists in the self.fig_dict already. If so, it will be used. 
#     If somebody passes in a "None" type or the word none, then *no* style changes will be applied during plotting, relative to what the record already has.
#     One can pass a style in for the plotting functions. In those cases, we'll use the remove style option, then apply.

    This function is designed to be called during creation of a plotly or matplotlib figure creation.
    Processes implicit data series (equation/simulate), adjusting ranges, performing simulations,

    The important thing is that this function creates a "fresh" fig_dict, does some manipulation, then then gets the data from that
    and adds it to the original fig_dict.
    That way the original fig_dict is not changed other than getting the simulated/evaluated data.

    The reason the function works this way is that the x_range_default of the implicit data series (equations and simulations)
    are adjusted to match the data in the fig_dict, but we don't want to change the x_range_default of our main record.
    That's why we make a copy for creating simulated/evaluated data from those adjusted ranges, and then put the simulated/evaluated data
