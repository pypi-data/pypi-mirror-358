This module integrates mail_tracking events with Mailgun webhooks.

`Mailgun <https://www.mailgun.com>`__ is a service that provides an
e-mail sending infrastructure through an SMTP server or via API. You can
also query that API for seeing statistics of your sent e-mails, or
provide hooks that processes the status changes in real time, which is
the function used here.

Installation
============

If you're using a multi-database installation (with or without dbfilter
option) where /web/databse/selector returns a list of more than one
database, then you need to add ``mail_tracking_mailgun`` addon to wide
load addons list (by default, only ``web`` addon), setting ``--load``
option.

Example: ``--load=web,mail_tracking,mail_tracking_mailgun``

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Mailgun, create an account and validate your sending domain.
2. Go back to Odoo.
3. Go to *Settings > General Settings > Discuss > Enable mail tracking
   with Mailgun*.
4. Fill all the values. The only one required is the API key.
5. Optionally click *Unregister Mailgun webhooks* and accept.
6. Click *Register Mailgun webhooks*.

You can also config timeout for mailgun with this system parameter:

- ``mailgun.timeout``: Set it to a number of seconds.

Usage
=====

In your mail tracking status screens (explained on module
*mail_tracking*), you will see a more accurate information, like the
'Received' or 'Bounced' status, which are not usually detected by normal
SMTP servers.

It's also possible to make some checks to the partner's email addresses
against the Mailgun API:

- Check if the partner's email is in Mailgun's bounced list.
- Check the validity of the partner's mailbox.
- Force the partner's email into Mailgun's bounced list or delete from
  it.

It's also possible to manually check a message mailgun tracking when the
webhook couldn't be captured. For that, go to that message tracking
form, press the button *Check Mailgun*. It's important to note that
tracking events have quite a short lifespan, so after 24h they won't be
recoverable.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- There's no support for more than one Mailgun mail server.
- Automate more webhook registration. It would be nice to not have to
  click the "Unregister Mailgun webhooks" and "Register Mailgun
  webhooks" when setting up Mailgun in Odoo. However, it doesn't come
  without its `conceptual
  complexities <https://github.com/OCA/social/pull/787#discussion_r734275262>`__.
