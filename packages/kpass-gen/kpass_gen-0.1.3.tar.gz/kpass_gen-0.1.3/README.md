# kpass 

**kpass** is a Python library that generates hundreds (or thousands) of password combinations based on a person's full name, age, and date of birth.

It also includes `leet`-style substitutions (e.g., A â†’ 4, S â†’ $, E â†’ 3), and automatically saves the generated passwords to a `.txt` file with progress bars using the `rich` library.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
pip install kpass-gen
```

ðŸš€ Example usage


```python
from kpass import generator

# Generate passwords based on personal data
generator(
    name="Jhonny Silverhand",
    age="34",
    birth_date="16/11/1988"
)
```

This will create a folder called passwords_generator containing a file named pass_generated.txt with valid password combinations between 6 and 18 characters.
