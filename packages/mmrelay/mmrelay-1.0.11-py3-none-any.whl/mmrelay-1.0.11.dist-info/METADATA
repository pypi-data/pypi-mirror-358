# M<>M Relay

## (Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay)

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

## Documentation

Visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki) for comprehensive guides and information.

- [Installation Instructions](docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Setup and configuration guide
- [v1.0 Release Announcement](docs/ANNOUNCEMENT.md) - New changes in v1.0
- [Upgrade Guide](docs/UPGRADE_TO_V1.md) - Migration guidance for existing users

---

## Quick Start

MMRelay runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

```bash
# Install using pipx for isolated installation (recommended)
pipx install mmrelay

# Generate a sample configuration file & then edit it
mmrelay --generate-config

# Start the relay (without --install-service to run manually)
mmrelay --install-service
```

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports serial, network, and **_BLE (now too!)_** connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom fields are embedded in Matrix messages for relaying messages between multiple meshnets
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store node information for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1
- Relays messages to/from an MQTT broker, if configured in the Meshtastic firmware
- ✨️ _Cross-platform reactions support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**

_We would love to support [Matrix E2EE rooms](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/issues/33), but this is currently not implemented._

## Plugins

M<>M Relay supports plugins for extending its functionality, enabling customization and enhancement of the relay to suit specific needs.

### Core Plugins

Generate a map of your nodes:

See the full list of core plugins [here](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Core-Plugins).

### Community & Custom Plugins

MMRelay's plugin system allows you to extend functionality in two ways:

- **Custom Plugins**: Create personal plugins for your own use, stored in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/custom/`
- **Community Plugins**: Share your creations with others or use plugins developed by the community

Check the [Community Plugins Development Guide](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-Development-Guide) in our wiki to get started.

✨️ Visit the [Community Plugins List](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-List)!

#### Install a Community Plugin

Add the repository under the `community-plugins` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
community-plugins:
  example-plugin:
    active: true
    repository: https://github.com/jeremiah-k/mmr-plugin-template.git
    tag: main
```

### Plugin System

Plugins make it easy to extend functionality without modifying the core program. MMRelay features a powerful plugin system with standardized locations:

- **Core Plugins**: Pre-installed with the package
- **Custom Plugins**: Your own plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/custom/`
- **Community Plugins**: Third-party plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/community/`
