Drag and Drop XBlock v2
=======================

This XBlock implements a friendly drag-and-drop style problem, where
the learner has to drag items to zones on a target image.

The editor is fully guided. Features include:

* custom target image
* free target zone positioning and sizing
* custom zone labels
* ability to show or hide zone borders
* custom text and background colors for items
* auto-alignment for items: left, right, center
* image items
* decoy items that don't have a zone
* feedback popups for both correct and incorrect attempts
* introductory and final feedback

The XBlock supports progressive grading and keeps progress across
refreshes. All checking and record keeping is done on the server side.

The following screenshot shows the Drag and Drop XBlock rendered
inside the edX LMS before the user starts solving the problem:

This screenshot shows the XBlock after the learner successfully
completed the Drag and Drop problem:

Installation
------------

Install the requirements into the Python virtual environment of your
`edx-platform` installation by running the following command from the
root folder:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Theming
-------

The Drag and Drop XBlock ships with an alternate theme called "Apros"
that you can enable by adding the following entry to `XBLOCK_SETTINGS`
in `lms.env.json`:

```json
        "drag-and-drop-v2": {
            "theme": {
                "package": "drag_and_drop_v2",
                "locations": ["public/themes/apros.css"]
            }
        }
```

You can use the same approach to apply a custom theme:

`"package"` can refer to any Python package in your virtualenv, which
means you can develop and maintain your own theme in a separate
package. There is no need to fork or modify this repository in any way
to customize the look and feel of your Drag and Drop problems.

`"locations"` is a list of relative paths pointing to CSS files
belonging to your theme. While the XBlock loads, files will be added
to it in the order that they appear in this list. (This means that if
there are rules with identical selectors spread out over different
files, rules in files that appear later in the list will take
precedence over those that appear earlier.)

Finally, note that the default (unthemed) appearance of the Drag and
Drop XBlock has been optimized for accessibility, so its use is
encouraged -- especially for courses targeting large and/or
potentially diverse audiences.

Enabling in Studio
------------------

Drag and Drop v2 XBlock is already included in Open edX.

You will find it in `"Add New Component"` box in Studio:
click the green `Problem` button, choose the the `Advanced` tab
and choose `Drag and Drop`.

Usage
-----

The Drag and Drop XBlock features an interactive editor. Add the Drag
and Drop component to a lesson, then click the `EDIT` button.

![Edit view](doc/img/edit-view.png)

In the first step, you can set some basic properties of the component, such as
the title, the problem mode, the maximum number of attempts, the maximum score,
the problem text to render above the background image, the introductory feedback
(shown initially), and the final feedback (shown after the learner successfully
completes the drag and drop problem, or when the learner runs out of attempts).

There are two problem modes available:

* **Standard**: In this mode, the learner gets immediate feedback on each
  attempt to place an item, and the number of attempts is not limited.
* **Assessment**: In this mode, the learner places all items on the board and
  then clicks a "Submit" button to get feedback.
  * The number of attempts can be limited.
  * The learner can click a "Show Answer" button to temporarily place items on their correct drop zones.    
    You can select one of the pre-defined conditions for displaying this button. They work in the same way as in the
    Problem XBlock, so you can read about each them in the [Problem Component documentation][capa-show-answer].  
    By default, the value from the course "Advanced Settings" configuration is used. If you have modified this for
    a specific XBlock but want to switch back to using the default value, select the "Default" option.

[capa-show-answer]: https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/educators/references/course_development/problem_settings.html#show-answer

![Drop zone edit](doc/img/edit-view-zones.png)

In the next step, you set the URL and description for the background
image and define the properties of the drop zones. For each zone you
can specify the text that should be rendered inside it (the "zone
label"), how wide and tall it should be, and where it should be placed
on the background image. In this step you can also specify whether you
would like zone labels to be shown to learners or not, as well as
whether or not to display borders outlining the zones. It is possible
to define an arbitrary number of drop zones as long as their labels
are unique.

You can specify the alignment for items once they are dropped in
the zone. Centered alignment is the default, and places items from top to bottom
along the center of the zone. Left alignment causes dropped items to be placed from left
to right across the zone. Right alignment causes the items to be placed from
right to left across the zone. Items dropped in a zone will not overlap,
but if the zone is not made large enough for all its items, they will overflow the bottom
of the zone, and potentially overlap the zones below.

![Drag item edit](doc/img/edit-view-items.png)

In the final step, you define the background and text color for drag items, as
well as the drag items themselves. A drag item can contain either text or an
image. You can define custom success and error feedback for each item. In
standard mode, the feedback text is displayed in a popup after the learner drops
the item on a zone - the success feedback is shown if the item is dropped on a
correct zone, while the error feedback is shown when dropping the item on an
incorrect drop zone.  In assessment mode, the success feedback texts
are not used, while error feedback texts are shown when learner submits a solution.

You can select any number of zones for an item to belong to using
the checkboxes; all zones defined in the previous step are available.
You can leave all of the checkboxes unchecked in order to create a
"decoy" item that doesn't belong to any zone.

You can define an arbitrary number of drag items, each of which may
be attached to any number of zones.

"Maximum items per Zone" setting controls how many items can be dropped into a
single zone, allowing some degree of control over items overlapping zones below.

Scoring
-------

Student assessment scores for the Drag and Drop XBlock are calculated according
to the following formula:

    score = (C + D) / T

Where *C* is the number of correctly placed regular items, *D* is the number of
decoy items that were correctly left unplaced, and *T* is the total number of
items available.

Example: consider a Drag and Drop instance configured with a total of four
items, of which three are regular items and one is a decoy.  If a learner
places two of the normal items correctly and one incorrectly (`C = 2`), and
wrongly places the decoy item onto a drop zone (`D = 0`), that learner's score
will be `50%`, as given by:

    score = (2 + 0) / 4

If the learner were to then move the decoy item back to the bank (`D = 1`) and
move the wrongly placed regular item to the correct dropzone (`C = 3`), their
score would be `100%`:

    score = (3 + 1) / 4

Optionally, there is an alternative grading that can be enabled, by setting the
waffle flag `drag_and_drop_v2.grading_ignore_decoys`, which will drop
the decoy items entirely from the score calculation. The formula will change to:

    score = C / R

Where *C* is the number of correctly placed regular items, *R* is the number of
required regular items.

$ make test.python TEST=tests/unit/test_basics.py::BasicTests::test_student_view_data
```


i18n compatibility
==================

According to [edX docs on XBlock i18n][edx-docs-i18n], LMS runtime is capable of supporting XBlock i18n and l10n.
To comply with l10n requirements, XBlock is supposed to provide translations in
`xblock_package_root/translations/locale_code/LC_MESSAGES/text.po` folder in GNU Gettext Portable Object file format.

[edx-docs-i18n]: https://docs.openedx.org/projects/xblock/en/latest/xblock-tutorial/edx_platform/edx_lms.html#internationalization-support

Drag and Drop v2 XBlock aims to comply with i18n requirements for Open edX platform, including a stricter set of
requirements for `edx.org` itself, thus providing the required files. So far only two translations are available:

* Default English translation
* Fake "Esperanto" translation used to test i18n/l10n.

Updates to translated strings are supposed to be propagated to `text.po` files. EdX [i18n_tools][edx-i18n-tools] is used here along GNU Gettext and a Makefile for automation.

[edx-i18n-tools]: https://github.com/openedx/i18n-tools

Note: currently `translations` directory is a symbolic link to `conf/locale` directory. Also, 'text.po' file for locale code `en` is a symbolic link to `conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` file. Both links works as a transition step to fully moving translation files to [openedx-translations](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations) repository

Translatable strings
--------------------
```bash
$ make extract_translations
```

Note that this command generates `text.po` which is supposed to contain
all translatable strings.

To check if `text.po` is correct, one can run:

```bash
$ make compile_translations
```

If everything is correct, it will create `translations/en/LC_MESSAGES/text.mo` and `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/text.js` files.

Building fake "Esperanto" translation
-------------------------------------

As previously said, this fake translation mainly exists for testing reasons. For edX platform it is built using Dummy
translator from edX i18n-tools.

```bash
$ make dummy_translations
```

Native API
----------

Further information on the API for native mobile applications can be found [here][native-api-doc].

Releasing
-------------------------------------
To release a new version, update .travis.yml and setup.py to point to your new intended version number and create a new release with that version tag via Github.
