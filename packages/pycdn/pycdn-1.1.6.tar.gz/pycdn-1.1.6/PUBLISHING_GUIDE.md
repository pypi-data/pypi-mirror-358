# PyCDN Publishing Guide - v1.1.3

## ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fix Release v1.1.3

**What's Fixed**: The major class instantiation bug that was preventing OpenAI and other classes from working properly.

### ðŸš€ Quick Publishing Steps

```bash
# 1. Verify the build (already done)
ls dist/  # Should show pycdn-1.1.3 files

# 2. Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/pycdn-1.1.3*

# Or if you want to test first:
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/pycdn-1.1.3*
```

### ðŸ“¦ What's Being Published

**Files Ready for Upload:**
- `pycdn-1.1.3-py3-none-any.whl` (48,230 bytes)
- `pycdn-1.1.3.tar.gz` (84,354 bytes)

### ðŸ”§ Critical Fix Summary

This release fixes the "OpenAI.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'" error that was blocking class instantiation. Both classic and natural import syntax now work perfectly:

- âœ… Classic: `cdn.openai.OpenAI(api_key=...)`
- âœ… Natural: `from cdn.openai import OpenAI; OpenAI(api_key=...)`

### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Release Matters

- **Immediate Impact**: Fixes the most critical user-blocking bug
- **Full Compatibility**: Both import patterns work flawlessly
- **Enhanced UX**: Added simple `server.py` setup script
- **Better Debugging**: Improved error messages and troubleshooting

### ðŸš€ Expected Outcome

After publishing v1.1.3:
- All class-based APIs (OpenAI, etc.) will work correctly
- User adoption barriers are removed
- Both syntax patterns are fully functional
- Developer experience is significantly improved
