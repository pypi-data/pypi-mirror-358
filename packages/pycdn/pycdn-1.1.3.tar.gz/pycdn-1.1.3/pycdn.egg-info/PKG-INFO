              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# PyCDN - Revolutionary Package CDN with Natural Import System 🚀

**The Netflix of Python packages** - Stream packages instantly without local installation!

PyCDN revolutionizes Python package management by serving packages through CDN networks with lazy loading and **natural import syntax**. Say goodbye to dependency hell and `pip install` delays!

## 🌟 Revolutionary Import System

PyCDN now supports **natural Python import syntax** using an advanced meta path import hook system. This means you can import packages directly from CDN servers as if they were installed locally!

### Classic Usage (Still Works)
```python
import pycdn

# Connect to CDN server
cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000")

# Use packages via attribute access
result = cdn.math.sqrt(16)  # Returns 4.0
data = cdn.numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
model = cdn.sklearn.LinearRegression()
```

### 🎯 NEW: Natural Import Syntax
```python
import pycdn

# Connect and register CDN
cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000")  # Registers 'cdn' prefix

# Now use natural Python imports!
from cdn.openai import OpenAI
from cdn.numpy import array, mean
from cdn.pandas import DataFrame
from cdn.sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Use exactly like local packages
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-key")
data = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
avg = mean(data)
df = DataFrame({"col1": [1, 2, 3]})
model = RandomForestClassifier()
```

### 🔧 Custom Import Prefixes
```python
# Use custom prefixes for different CDN servers
ml_cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://ml-cdn:8000", prefix="ml")
data_cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://data-cdn:8000", prefix="data")

# Import from different CDNs
from ml.tensorflow import keras
from ml.pytorch import nn
from data.pandas import DataFrame
from data.dask import dataframe as dd
```

### 🏢 Multiple CDN Support
```python
# Connect to multiple CDN environments
prod = pycdn.pkg("http://prod-cdn:8000", prefix="prod")
dev = pycdn.pkg("http://dev-cdn:8000", prefix="dev")
test = pycdn.pkg("http://test-cdn:8000", prefix="test")

# Import from specific environments
from prod.stable_package import ProductionClass
from dev.beta_package import ExperimentalFeature
from test.mock_package import TestDouble
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🔥 Natural Import Syntax**: Use `from cdn.package import Class` - feels exactly like local imports
- **⚡ Instant Access**: No `pip install` required - packages execute remotely
- **🌍 Global CDN**: Packages served from edge locations worldwide
- **🔒 Zero Dependencies**: No local installation or dependency conflicts
- **💾 Smart Caching**: Intelligent caching with hybrid in-memory + disk storage
- **🛡️ Security**: Sandboxed execution with runtime security scanning
- **📊 Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring
- **🔄 Multi-CDN**: Connect to multiple CDN servers simultaneously
- **🧰 Development Mode**: Local fallback and enhanced debugging

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install pycdn
```

## 📖 Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage
```python
import pycdn

# Connect to CDN
cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000")

# Classic usage
result = cdn.math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # 4.0

# Natural imports (NEW!)
from cdn.math import sqrt, pow
print(sqrt(25))    # 5.0
print(pow(2, 3))   # 8.0
```

### 2. Working with Classes
```python
import pycdn

cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000")

# Import and use classes naturally
from cdn.openai import OpenAI
from cdn.sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create instances and call methods
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-key")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 3. Data Science Workflow
```python
import pycdn

# Connect to data science CDN
ds_cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://ds-cdn:8000", prefix="ds")

# Natural imports for entire data pipeline
from ds.pandas import DataFrame, read_csv
from ds.numpy import array, mean, std
from ds.matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ds.sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from ds.sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from ds.sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Use exactly like local packages
df = read_csv("data.csv")
X = df[["feature1", "feature2"]]
y = df["target"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"MSE: {mse}")
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Dynamic Prefix Management
```python
cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000", prefix="initial")

# Change prefix dynamically
cdn.set_prefix("dynamic")

# Enable specific package imports
cdn.enable_imports(["tensorflow", "pytorch", "scikit-learn"])

# Now these work:
from dynamic.tensorflow import keras
from dynamic.pytorch import nn
```

### Error Handling
```python
from pycdn import PyCDNRemoteError

try:
    from cdn.nonexistent import something
except PyCDNRemoteError as e:
    print(f"CDN Error: {e.message}")
    print(f"Package: {e.package_name}")
    if e.remote_traceback:
        print(f"Remote traceback: {e.remote_traceback}")
```

### Development Mode
```python
# Configure for development
pycdn.configure(debug=True, timeout=60)

cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000", prefix="dev")
# Enables local fallback, enhanced debugging, mock mode
```

### CDN Management
```python
# View active CDN mappings
mappings = pycdn.get_cdn_mappings()
print(mappings)  # {'cdn': 'http://localhost:8000', 'ml': 'http://ml-cdn:8000'}

# Clear all mappings
pycdn.clear_cdn_mappings()

# Register/unregister specific prefixes
pycdn.register_cdn_client("custom", cdn_client)
pycdn.unregister_cdn_client("custom")
```

## 🏗️ Server Setup

Deploy packages to your CDN server:

```python
from pycdn.server import CDNServer

# Create CDN server
server = CDNServer(port=8000)

# Deploy packages
server.deploy_package("math", version="1.0.0")
server.deploy_package("numpy", version="1.24.0")
server.deploy_package("openai", version="1.0.0")

# Start server
server.start()
```

## 🌐 Meta Path Import System

PyCDN uses Python's `sys.meta_path` to intercept imports and resolve them from CDN servers:

```python
import sys
import pycdn

# When you create a CDN connection
cdn = pycdn.pkg("http://localhost:8000", prefix="cdn")

# PyCDN automatically:
# 1. Registers a MetaPathFinder in sys.meta_path
# 2. Maps the 'cdn' prefix to your CDN client
# 3. Intercepts imports starting with 'cdn.'
# 4. Creates proxy objects that execute remotely
# 5. Handles classes, functions, modules transparently

# All of this happens automatically!
from cdn.package import Class  # Intercepted and resolved
```

## 🔧 Configuration

```python
# Global configuration
pycdn.configure(
    debug=True,
    timeout=30,
    cache_size="100MB",
    max_retries=3
)

# Per-connection configuration
cdn = pycdn.pkg(
    "http://localhost:8000",
    prefix="cdn",
    timeout=60,
    api_key="your-api-key",
    region="us-east-1",
    cache_size="500MB",
    max_retries=5,
    debug=True
)
```

## 📊 Performance

- **🚀 First call**: ~50-100ms (network + execution)
- **⚡ Cached calls**: ~1-5ms (local cache hit)
- **💾 Memory usage**: Minimal (only proxy objects stored locally)
- **🌍 Global reach**: CDN edge servers reduce latency worldwide
- **📈 Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand

## 🛡️ Security

- **🔒 Sandboxed execution**: Each package runs in isolated environment
- **🛡️ Runtime scanning**: Real-time security vulnerability detection
- **🚫 Package allowlists**: Control which packages can be imported
- **🔐 API authentication**: Secure CDN access with API keys
- **📝 Audit logs**: Complete execution history and monitoring
