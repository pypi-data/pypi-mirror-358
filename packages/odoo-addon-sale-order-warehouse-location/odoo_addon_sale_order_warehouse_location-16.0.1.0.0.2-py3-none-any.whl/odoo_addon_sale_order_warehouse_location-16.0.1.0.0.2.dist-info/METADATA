This module allows to set countries and states in warehouses, so they
can automatically be set in a sale order when its shipping address
matches the countries and states selected in a given warehouse.

Configuration
=============

In configure countries and states in warehouses you need to:

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses and access a warehouse.
2. Select the countries and/or states where the warehouse has to be
   automatically set in a sale order based on its shipping address. Only
   states that belong to the selected countries can be chosen.

Usage
=====

When the shipping address field in a sale order is modified, it is
checked whether a warehouse is applied in the region according to the
shipping address' country and state. In order to determine if the
warehouse matches the address, the country in the shipping address must
be part of the "Sale Order Countries" field in a warehouse. Moreover, if
the warehouse has some states in its "Sale Order States" field, the
state in the shipping address must be part of this field too. If no
warehouses are found, the default process for warehouse selection is
followed.

Keep in mind that the Warehouse field in sale orders is only visible if
the user has multi-warehouse rights.
