class HttpUrl(PydanticHttpUrl):
    """
    A subclass of `pydantic.HttpUrl` that adds some useful methods and operator overloads for more ergonomic path manipulation and URL composition.

    Operations:
      - `url / "segment"`  - returns a new HttpUrl with "segment" appended to the path
      - `url /= "segment"` - in-place append of "segment" to the path

    Examples:
        >>> u = HttpUrl("https://example.com/api")
        >>> u2 = u / "v1" / "users"
        >>> print(u2)
        https://example.com/api/v1/users

        >>> u2 /= "123"
        >>> print(u2)
        https://example.com/api/v1/users/123
