# README

**pnvm** (sometimes **PNVM**), is a small, FOSS utility for managing Node.js versions.  
It is written in Python, and more specifically Python >= 3.13, and focuses on **security**.

## Installing

You may install this utility via `pip`, kinda like this:
```bash
# NOTE: Don't install inside a `venv` unless you know what you are doing.
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pnvm

# If pnvm hasn't been added to $PATH, do the following:
# NOTE: replace `.bashrc` with whatever equivalent if you're using a shell which isn't bash.
$ echo 'export PATH="/home/axelkarlsson/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Source the RC file again.
$ . ~/.bashrc
```

## License

pnvm is **free software** licensed under the **GNU GPLv3**, or, if available, any later version.

## Examples

Installing Node.js version 18.20.8 via `pnvm`:
```bash
# NOTE: You may also write "--install".
$ pnvm -i v18.20.8
...
# Show list of versions:
$ pnvm -l
v18.20.8
# Switch to the newly installed version:
$ pnvm -c v18.20.8

$ node
Welcome to Node.js v18.20.8.
...
```

## Security

If there are any issues regarding security, please contact me via the email  
connected to `git`, or, preferrably, open an issue on GitLab.  

It is rather important to do so since this project is decently focused on security.

## Contact

Please open an issue on GitLab before contacting me.  
If you want to email me, you may do so via the email connected to `git`.

## Extra Notes

I've never ever published a project to PyPI and I'm gonna be honest and admit that I'm a  
beginner to it. Feel free to help me out if you're more experienced.
