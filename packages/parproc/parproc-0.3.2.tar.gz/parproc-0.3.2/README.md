# PARPROC

A library for parallelizing scripts, by allowing different script elements to be grouped in
processes, and allowing each group to depend on the completion of one or more other groups


# Installation and Usage

## Installation

```sh
pip install parproc
```

## Usage

See ```examples/success.py``` for an example. Different jobs can be defined and dependencies between them established, e.g.:

```python
import parproc as pp

@pp.Proc(now=True)
def func0(context):
    time.sleep(1)


@pp.Proc(now=True)
def func1(context):
    time.sleep(3)


@pp.Proc(now=True)
def func2(context, deps=['func0', 'func1']):
    time.sleep(2)
```

The ```now=True``` argument kicks off the jobs as soon as they are defined, which is optional. The example then waits for all jobs to finish

```python
pp.wait_for_all()
```
