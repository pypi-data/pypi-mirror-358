3. Include data transformations, calculations, and key findings
4. Use appropriate node shapes for different elements:
   - [Rectangle] for data objects and processes
   - (Rounded Rectangle) for algorithms or operations
   - {{Hexagon}} for decision points
   - >Asymmetric] for results or outputs

5. Use descriptive but concise node texts
6. Create connections that show the logical flow of analysis
7. Add subgraphs for logically grouped operations
8. For SQL analysis, include query structure and outcomes
9. DO NOT include any explanatory text or markdown formatting
10. When text in square brackets [] contains parentheses (), it must be enclosed in double quotes: ["text (with parentheses)"]

Example for a CVS analysis:
flowchart TD
    A["Raw Data CSV"] --> B[Clean Missing Values]
    B --> C[Calculate Monthly Revenue]
    C --> D[Identify Growth Trend]
    D --> E>15% Annual Growth Rate]
    D --> F>Seasonal Pattern Detected]
