# pycreep

This package correlates creep data using time-temperature parameters, including
the Larson-Miller parameters.  It also serves as a test bed for developing
alternative means to correlate and extrapolate creep rupture and creep
deformation test data.

The examples directory contains several examples correlating data against 
synthetic rupture and deformation data.
