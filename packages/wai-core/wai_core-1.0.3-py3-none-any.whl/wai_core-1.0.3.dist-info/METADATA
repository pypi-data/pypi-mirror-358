# Core library for the WorldAI format (WAI)
Core functionality to access and process data in the WorldAI format (WAI).
Lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on modularity and extensibility.

# Features
- IO functions for reading and writing WAI data
- Intersection checks between 2d/3d geometric primitives
- Batched camera and geometric processing functions (e.g. (un)projection, transformations, etc)

# Install
(Recommended option) Pip install
```
pip install wai-core
```
(Development option) Clone and install from source:
```
git clone https://ghe.oculus-rep.com/mb-research/wai-core.git
cd wai-core
pip install -e .
```
