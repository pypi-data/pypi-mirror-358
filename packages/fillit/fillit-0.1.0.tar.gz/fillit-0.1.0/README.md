## Examples:

## Code Quality:

This is one of my first python project (2015), originaly coded in python 2.7 for learning purposes and then updated to version 3 so that students can continue to use it (thanks for pointing out that it was no longer working btw). It is slow and not optimized but the output is still valid and I'll probably keep it as is to remind me of my beginnings :)
