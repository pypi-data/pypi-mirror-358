### Demo report

In this demo, we applied QCatch to a publicly available dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), obtained from the [10X Genomics website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/1-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-v-3-chemistry-3-standard-3-0-0).

This dataset comprises scRNA-seq data from 1k PBMCs isolated from a healthy human donor, generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3' Gene Expression v3 chemistry.
