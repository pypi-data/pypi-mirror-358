# PyCCE-RC

PyCCE-RC is a Python package implementing the Common Correlated Effects (CCE)[2] estimators for panel data models with unobserved common factors. The package also incorporates a recently proposed rank condition (RC) test[1], alongside their proposed augmentation algorithm[1] designed to restore the RC when violated. PyCCE-RC supports all three CCE estimators and enables verification of the RC assumption critical for estimator consistency.

## üì¶ Features

- Implementation of all three CCE estimators:
  - **Individual-specific CCE**
  - **Mean Group CCE**
  - **Pooled CCE**

- Built-in tools for:
  - Verifying the **rank condition** (RC test)
  - Performing **augmentation algorithm** to (potentially) restore the RC

- Compatible with balanced and unbalanced panel data

- Modular design:
  - `py_cce.base`: core data structures and base for estimation logic
  - `py_cce.models`:  estimator classes
  - `py_cce.utils`: CSA computation, rank condition testing, and other utilities

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some numerical instabilities may occur during estimation, affecting both the estimator classes and the rank condition test. These issues are known and will be addressed in future versions.

## üõ† Installation

```bash
pip install pycce-rc
```
