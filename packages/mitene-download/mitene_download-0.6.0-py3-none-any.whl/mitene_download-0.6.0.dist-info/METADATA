## Usage

Install with `pip install mitene_download`.

From mitene app, invite a family member for the web version and copy the URL ( that should be something like `https://mitene.us/f/abcd123456` )

Run the script with `mitene_download https://mitene.us/f/abcd123456`, using the URL from previous step.
