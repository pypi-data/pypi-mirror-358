Randex is a library that creates exams by randomizing multiple-choice questions selected
from a user-defined pool of questions.
The final exam is generated as a LaTeX document and compiled into a PDF.
Multiple exams can be created at once.

## Installation

Randex requires Python version `3.10` or higher, `Poetry`, and `latexmk`.

### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is the packaging and dependency manager used for
this project.
To install Poetry, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).

### latexmk

From [here](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html):
```
Latexmk is a Perl script which you just have to run once and it does everything else for you... completely automagically.
```

and [here](https://www.cantab.net/users/johncollins/latexmk/)

```
Latexmk is also available at CTAN at https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/, and is/will be in the TeXLive and MiKTeX distributions.
```

If you have already `Latex` installed in your system, you will most
probably have already `latexmk` installed as well.

### Randex

To install Randex, run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```sh
poetry install
```

Then execute:

```sh
poetry shell
```

to spawn a shell with the Python environment activated.

## Randex Data Scheme

Randex requires two types of data files to create the exams.

### Tex File

The `Tex` file is a `YAML` file that describes the LaTeX file that will produce the exam. It contains the following keys:

- `documentclass` (optional): String with the documentclass command of the file. Only the `exam` class is supported. Default:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[11pt]{exam}
    ```
- `prebegin` (optional): String containing everything that goes before the `\begin{document}` command. Default:
    ```latex
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \usepackage{amssymb}
    \usepackage{bm}
    \usepackage{geometry}

    \geometry{
        a4paper,
        total={160mm,250mm},
        left=15mm,
        right=15mm,
        top=20mm,
    }

    \linespread{1.2}
    \pagestyle{head}
    \runningheadrule
    ```
- `postbegin` (optional): String with all the commands right after the "\begin{document}" command. Default: empty string.
- `preend` (optional): String with all the commands right before the "\end{document}" command. Default: empty string.
- `lhead` (optional): String that is displayed on the left part of the head. Default: empty string
- `chead` (optional): String that is displayed on the center part of the head. Default: empty string

The right part of the head is reserved for the serial number of the exam.

### Questions File

Each question is written in a `YAML` file with the following keys:

- `question` (required): String with the question. Do not use double quotes around the string.
- `answers` (required): List of strings with the answers. Do not use double quotes around the strings.
- `right_answer` (required): Integer indicating the correct answer.
The answer is non-negative and less than the length of the `answers` list.
- `points` (optional): Points given to the question. Default: `1`

The questions `YAML` files should be organized inside folders.

The `randex` commands take the `Tex` file and the folders containing the exams as inputs.

## Randex Commands

Inside an activated environment, you can run the following commands.

### Validate

This command validates a single question or all questions inside a folder. Execute:

```sh
validate example/en -t example/en/tex.yaml -o temp --clean -a
```

to validate all the questions inside the folder `example/en` that contains subfolders
with questions.
It will use the configuration from the file `example/en/tex.yaml`.
The LaTeX compilation will run inside the `temp` folder.
The `--clean` option will remove all intermediate files created by LaTeX,
and the `-a` flag will show the correct answers in the produced PDF.
Open the PDF file inside `temp` to validate that all questions appear correctly.

Run:

```sh
validate --help
```

to see the help message for the command.

### Exams

To create a batch of exams with random questions, execute:

```sh
exams example/en/folder_0/ example/en/folder_1/ example/en/folder_2/ -b 10 -t example/en/tex.yaml --clean -n 2
```

This command will create 10 exams from 3 folders using the configuration from the file
`example/en/tex.yaml`.
The `--clean` option will remove all intermediate files created by LaTeX.
The `-n` option specifies the number of questions randomly chosen from each folder.
It can appear once, meaning all folders will contribute the same number of questions,
or multiple times, e.g., `-n 2 -n 1`, indicating the first folder will contribute
2 questions, and the remaining folders will contribute 1 question each.
For example, `-n 2 -n 1 -n 3` means the first, second,
and third folders will contribute 2, 1, and 3 questions, respectively.
The `-b` option specifies the number of exams to create.
