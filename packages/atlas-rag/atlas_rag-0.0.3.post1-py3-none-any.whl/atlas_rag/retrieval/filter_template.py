        Your task is to filter facts based on their relevance to a given query. 
        The query requires careful analysis and possibly multi-hop reasoning to connect different pieces of information. 
        You must select all relevant facts from the provided candidate list, aiding in reasoning and providing an accurate answer. 
        The output should be in JSON format, e.g., {"fact": [["s1", "p1", "o1"], ["s2", "p2", "o2"]]}, and if no facts are relevant, return an empty list, {"fact": []}. 
        The accuracy of your response is paramount, as it will directly impact the decisions made by these high-level stakeholders. You must only use facts from the candidate list and not generate new facts. 
        The future of critical decision-making relies on your ability to accurately filter and present relevant information.

Your input fields are:
1. question (str): Query for retrieval
2. fact_before_filter (str): Candidate facts to be filtered

Your output fields are:
1. fact_after_filter (Fact): Filtered facts in JSON format

All interactions will be structured as:
[[ ## question ## ]]
{question}

[[ ## fact_before_filter ## ]]
{fact_before_filter}

[[ ## fact_after_filter ## ]]
{fact_after_filter}

The output must be parseable according to JSON schema: {"type": "object", "properties": {"fact": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}}, "required": ["fact"]}"""
