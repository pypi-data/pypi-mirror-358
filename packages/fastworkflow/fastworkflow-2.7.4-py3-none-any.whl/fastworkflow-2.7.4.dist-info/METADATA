# fastWorkflow
A framework for rapidly building large-scale, deterministic, interactive workflows with a fault-tolerant, conversational UX and AI-powered recommendations.

- Built on the principle on "Convention over configuration", ALA Ruby on Rails
- Uses:
  - A custom-built intent detection pipeline for fault-tolerant, self-correcting command routing
  - [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) and [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) for parameter extraction and response generation

# Concepts
- Workflows are defined as a directory hierarchy of workitem types
  - Workitems can be ordered
  - Min/max constraints can be defined for the number of child workitems (one, unlimited, min/max)
  - Workflows can delegate to other workflows
- Commands are exposed for each workitem type
  - Commands may be specific to one workitem type or inheritable by child workitem types (base commands)
- Users are guided through the workflow but have complete control over navigation
  - Workflow navigation and command execution are exposed via a chat interface
  - Special constrained workflows are used to handle routing and parameter extraction errors
- AI-powered recommendations after every command interaction
  - Recommendations are generated AFTER a command has been processed. The user has complete control over the workflow and discretion over whether to follow a recommendation or take a different action.

# Getting started
- Clone the repo
  - Use WSL if you are on Windows
- Create a .env file in the passwords folder and add below keys if required
  - LITELLM_API_KEY_SYNDATA_GEN
  - LITELLM_API_KEY_PARAM_EXTRACTION
  - LITELLM_API_KEY_RESPONSE_GEN
  - LITELLM_API_KEY_AGENT
- Train fastworkflow, then train the sample workflow, finally run the sample workflow agent or assistant
  - Hint: review the .vscode/launch.json file for training/running the sample workflow
 
# Future Roadmap
- AI enabled python applications 
- Tools to enable rapid application development - declarative/imperative/visual
