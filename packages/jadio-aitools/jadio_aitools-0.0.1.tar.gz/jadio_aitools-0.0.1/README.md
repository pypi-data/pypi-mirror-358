📦 How AITools Works
When you run:

nginx
Copy
Edit
jadio install aitools
✅ It simply delivers the jadio_aitools/ folder into your project.

This folder is full of ready-to-use Python utilities for local development.

It doesn’t register servers, start services, or set up commands automatically. Instead, it acts as a toolbox you can import and use however you want in your own scripts or apps.

🗂️ What You Get
After installation, you’ll have:

markdown
Copy
Edit
project-root/
└── jadio_aitools/
    ├── backup_file.py
    ├── code_search.py
    ├── convert_to_pdf.py
    ├── encryptor.py
    ├── ...
Each module is independent and designed to be:

✅ Imported directly in your own code
✅ Called as a standalone script if you want
✅ Modified or extended locally

✅ Philosophy
AITools is delivery-first:

No automatic setup.

No forced integration.

Just deliver the tools.

You choose how and where to use them in your own local AI workflows.
