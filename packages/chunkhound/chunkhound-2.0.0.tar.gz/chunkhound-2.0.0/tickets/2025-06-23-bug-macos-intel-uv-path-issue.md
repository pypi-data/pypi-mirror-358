# [BUG] macOS Intel UV PATH Configuration Issue

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Date:** 2025-06-23  
**Platform:** macOS Intel (x86_64)  
**Component:** CI/CD Build Pipeline  

## Problem Description

The macOS Intel build fails in the GitHub Actions workflow because UV is not found in PATH after installation. The workflow installs UV to `~/.local/bin` but the cache and PATH configuration expects it in `~/.cargo/bin`.

## Error Details

```bash
/Users/runner/work/_temp/04c75164-e1ca-4975-b585-d36e93f5c45e.sh: line 15: uv: command not found
##[error]Process completed with exit code 127.
```

## Root Cause

In `.github/workflows/cross-platform-build.yml`, the macOS build section has a mismatch:

1. **UV Installation**: Actually installs to `~/.local/bin`
   ```bash
   downloading uv 0.7.13 x86_64-apple-darwin
   installing to /Users/runner/.local/bin
   ```

2. **Cache Configuration**: Expects UV in `~/.cargo/bin`
   ```yaml
   - name: Cache UV Installation
     if: startsWith(matrix.platform, 'macos')
     uses: actions/cache@v3
     with:
       path: ~/.cargo/bin/uv  # ❌ Wrong path
   ```

3. **PATH Setup**: Also expects `~/.cargo/bin`
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"  # ❌ Wrong path
   ```

## Expected Behavior

The macOS Intel build should complete successfully like the macOS ARM64 build did.

## Solution

Update the macOS build configuration in the workflow:

1. **Fix cache path:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Cache UV Installation
     if: startsWith(matrix.platform, 'macos')
     uses: actions/cache@v3
     with:
       path: ~/.local/bin/uv  # ✅ Correct path
   ```

2. **Fix PATH export:**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # ✅ Correct path
   ```

3. **Update cache check:**
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f ~/.local/bin/uv ]; then  # ✅ Correct path
   ```

## Files Affected

- `.github/workflows/cross-platform-build.yml` (lines ~196, ~205, ~208)

## Testing

This can be verified by:
1. Applying the path fixes
2. Running the workflow with manual dispatch
3. Confirming macOS Intel build completes successfully

## Related Issues

- Works correctly on macOS ARM64 (same UV installation method)
- No issues with Windows UV installation (uses different path structure)

# History

## 2025-06-23T16:30:00Z
**INITIAL FIX ATTEMPTED**: Fixed all three path mismatches in `.github/workflows/cross-platform-build.yml`:
1. Updated cache path from `~/.cargo/bin/uv` to `~/.local/bin/uv` (line 196)
2. Updated PATH export from `$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH` to `$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` (line 208) 
3. Updated cache check from `~/.cargo/bin/uv` to `~/.local/bin/uv` (line 205)

**VERIFICATION FINDINGS**: Initial path fixes were correct but insufficient. Testing revealed:
- ✅ macOS ARM64 builds consistently succeed
- ❌ macOS Intel builds still fail with exit code 127 (command not found)
- The UV installation script appears to behave differently on Intel vs ARM64 macs

## 2025-06-23T17:00:00Z
**DEBUGGING PROGRESS**: Added comprehensive debugging to understand the issue:
1. Added system architecture detection (`uname -m`, `uname -a`)
2. Enhanced search for UV binary in all potential locations
3. Set explicit `UV_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable
4. Implemented architecture-specific installation logic:
   - Intel Macs: Direct binary download from GitHub releases
   - ARM64 Macs: Use install script (proven working)

**COMMITS MADE**:
- `9a439e7`: Fix macOS Intel UV PATH configuration
- `edc37c4`: Add debugging for UV installation on macOS  
- `1537b3d`: Enhanced UV installation debugging for macOS
- `206408f`: Set explicit UV_INSTALL_DIR for macOS builds
- `d8415f2`: Use direct binary download for Intel Mac UV installation

**STATUS**: Issue partially diagnosed but not fully resolved. The problem appears to be with UV installation script behavior on Intel Macs in GitHub Actions environment, not just PATH configuration.

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Analyze workflow logs from failed Intel runs to identify exact failure point
2. May need to investigate GitHub Actions macOS Intel runner environment specifics
3. Consider alternative UV installation methods for Intel Macs
4. Test if the direct binary download approach resolves the issue
