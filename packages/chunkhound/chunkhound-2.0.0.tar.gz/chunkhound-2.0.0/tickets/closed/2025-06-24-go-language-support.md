# Go Language Support

**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Completed

## Objective

Add comprehensive Go programming language support to ChunkHound, enabling semantic parsing and chunking of Go codebases through tree-sitter integration.

## Scope

### Core Requirements
- **Language Integration**: Add `GO = "go"` to Language enum in `core/types/common.py`
- **File Extension Mapping**: Support `.go` files with proper language detection
- **Tree-sitter Parser**: Implement `GoParser` class using tree-sitter-go grammar
- **Semantic Chunking**: Extract Go-specific semantic elements

### Go-Specific Chunk Types
- **Package Declarations**: `package main` statements
- **Import Statements**: `import` blocks and individual imports  
- **Function Declarations**: Regular functions and methods with receivers
- **Type Declarations**: Structs, interfaces, type aliases, and custom types
- **Constant/Variable Declarations**: `const` and `var` blocks
- **Method Declarations**: Functions with receivers (struct methods)

### Technical Implementation
- **Parser Location**: `providers/parsing/go_parser.py`
- **Tree-sitter Integration**: Use existing `tree_sitter_language_pack` with Go bindings
- **Chunk Patterns**: Based on Go AST nodes (function_declaration, method_declaration, type_declaration, etc.)
- **Import Handling**: Process both grouped and individual import statements
- **Comment Support**: Extract documentation comments and regular comments

## Tree-sitter Grammar Patterns

Key Go AST nodes for chunking:
- `function_declaration` - Regular functions
- `method_declaration` - Methods with receivers  
- `type_declaration` - Type definitions and aliases
- `const_declaration` - Constant declarations
- `var_declaration` - Variable declarations
- `import_declaration` - Import statements
- `struct_type` - Struct definitions
- `interface_type` - Interface definitions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Language Support** - Add Go to Language enum and file extension mapping
2. **Parser Implementation** - Create GoParser class following existing patterns
3. **Semantic Rules** - Define Go-specific chunking logic
4. **Testing** - Add Go test fixtures and parser tests
5. **Integration** - Update language registry and configuration

## Expected Benefits

- **Go Codebase Indexing**: Enable semantic search across Go projects
- **Function/Method Discovery**: Precise location of Go functions and methods
- **Type System Understanding**: Index structs, interfaces, and custom types
- **Import Analysis**: Track package dependencies and usage patterns

## Dependencies

- tree-sitter-language-pack (Go grammar already available)
- Existing ChunkHound parser infrastructure
- Go test fixtures for validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Go files are properly detected and categorized
- [x] All major Go constructs are extracted as semantic chunks
- [x] Parser handles Go-specific syntax (receivers, interfaces, channels)
- [x] Test coverage includes representative Go code samples
- [x] Performance remains acceptable for large Go codebases

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Go language support with the following components:

1. **Language Integration**: Added `GO = "go"` to Language enum in `core/types/common.py`
2. **File Extension Mapping**: Added `.go` file extension support with proper language detection
3. **Tree-sitter Parser**: Created `GoParser` class in `providers/parsing/go_parser.py` using tree-sitter-go grammar
4. **Semantic Chunking**: Implemented extraction of Go-specific semantic elements:
   - **Package Declarations**: `package main` statements  
   - **Function Declarations**: Regular functions with parameter and return type extraction
   - **Method Declarations**: Functions with receivers (struct methods)
   - **Struct Definitions**: Type definitions for structs
   - **Interface Definitions**: Interface type declarations
   - **Type Declarations**: Type aliases and custom types
   - **Variable/Constant Declarations**: `const` and `var` blocks and individual declarations
5. **Registry Integration**: Updated language registry to include Go parser
6. **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases covering all major Go constructs
7. **Documentation**: Updated README.md to include Go in supported languages table

All tests pass and the implementation meets the acceptance criteria. Go codebases can now be indexed and searched using both semantic and regex search functionality.
