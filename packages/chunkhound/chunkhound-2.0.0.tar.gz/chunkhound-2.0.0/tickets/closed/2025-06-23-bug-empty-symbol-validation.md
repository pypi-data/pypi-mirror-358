# [BUG] Empty Symbol Validation Failures

**Date**: 2025-06-23  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: `providers/parsing/python_parser.py`

## Problem

Symbol validation errors occur during file processing:
```
Failed to process file chunkhound/file_watcher.py: Validation failed for field 'symbol': Symbol cannot be empty
Failed to process file chunkhound/mcp_server.py: Validation failed for field 'symbol': Symbol cannot be empty
```

## Root Cause

From codebase analysis, the issue appears when:
1. Special characters/emojis are filtered to empty strings during symbol creation
2. The validation logic `if not self.symbol or not self.symbol.strip()` fails
3. No fallback mechanism exists for empty filtered symbols

## Solution

Implement fallback symbol generation when filtered symbols are empty:
- Use line-number-based fallback pattern (e.g., `line_N`)
- Apply same pattern used in paragraph extraction
- Ensure symbol uniqueness within file scope

## Resolution

Fixed by adding fallback symbol generation in Python parser when AST identifiers are empty:

**Changes made in `providers/parsing/python_parser.py`:**
- Added `.strip()` and empty checks for function names (line 206-210)  
- Added `.strip()` and empty checks for class names (line 267-271)
- Added `.strip()` and empty checks for method names (line 339-343)
- Fallback patterns: `function_{line_number}`, `class_{line_number}`, `method_{line_number}`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] file_watcher.py processes without symbol validation errors
- [x] mcp_server.py processes without symbol validation errors  
- [x] Fallback symbols are generated when filtering results in empty strings
- [x] No regression in existing symbol generation logic
