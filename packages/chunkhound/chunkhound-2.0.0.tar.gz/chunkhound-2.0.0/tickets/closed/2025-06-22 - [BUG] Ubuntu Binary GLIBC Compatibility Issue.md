# [BUG] Ubuntu Binary GLIBC Compatibility Issue

**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Binary Distribution  

## Issue Description

The standalone Linux onedir binary fails to launch on Ubuntu systems with the following error:

```
libpython3.11.so.1.0: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.35` not found
```

## Environment

- **Target OS:** Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (minimum support requirement)
- **Binary Type:** Standalone Linux onedir
- **Missing Dependency:** GLIBC_2.35

## Impact

- Binary unusable on Ubuntu systems without GLIBC_2.35
- Limits distribution compatibility
- Prevents usage on older Ubuntu LTS versions

## Root Cause

The binary was likely built on a system with GLIBC_2.35+ and requires the same version at runtime. Ubuntu systems with older GLIBC versions cannot run the binary.

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Build on older base system** - Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or similar for binary builds ✅
2. **Static linking** - Investigate static linking options for GLIBC dependencies
3. **Multiple binary targets** - Create separate binaries for different GLIBC versions
4. **Docker/AppImage** - Alternative distribution methods that bundle dependencies ✅

## Recommended Solution: Docker Cross-Build

Based on research, the most effective approach is using Docker with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as the base system:

### Docker Images for PyInstaller with GLIBC Compatibility:
- **cdrx/pyinstaller-linux**: Uses older GLIBC for better compatibility
- **ripiuk/pyinstaller-many-linux**: Specifically designed with glibc v2.5 for maximum compatibility

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create Dockerfile based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
2. Build ChunkHound binary inside Docker container
3. Extract binary with compatible GLIBC dependencies

### Example Docker Build Command:
```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/src/" cdrx/pyinstaller-linux
```

This approach ensures binaries built with newer development systems can run on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS and newer versions.

## Next Steps

- [x] Identify minimum Ubuntu version to support (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS)
- [x] Research Docker-based cross-compilation solution
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for Ubuntu 20.04 based build environment
- [ ] Test binary compatibility across Ubuntu versions starting with 20.04.6 LTS
- [ ] Update build pipeline for broader compatibility
- [ ] Document system requirements clearly

## History

### 2025-06-22T14:30:00Z
Research completed on Docker-based cross-compilation solutions. Found two viable Docker images:
1. **cdrx/pyinstaller-linux** - Maintained, uses older GLIBC, supports Python 3.7
2. **ripiuk/pyinstaller-many-linux** - Uses very old glibc v2.5 for maximum compatibility

Recommended approach: Use Docker container based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to build PyInstaller binaries that are compatible with the target GLIBC version. This solves the forward compatibility issue where binaries built on newer systems can't run on older systems.

### 2025-06-22T16:20:00Z
**RESOLUTION COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented Docker-based build solution:

#### What was done:
1. Created `Dockerfile.ubuntu20` using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as base image
2. Updated `scripts/build.sh` to use the new Dockerfile for Ubuntu builds
3. Modified build pipeline to extract artifacts properly from Docker container
4. Tested build and binary compatibility

#### Results:
- **Before**: Binary required GLIBC_2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- **After**: Binary requires maximum GLIBC_2.14 (Ubuntu 16.04+)
- **Binary tested**: Successfully runs on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Build command**: `./scripts/build.sh ubuntu`
- **Output**: `dist/chunkhound-ubuntu20-amd64.tar.gz`

#### Verification:
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/dist/chunkhound-ubuntu-amd64:/app" ubuntu:20.04 /app/chunkhound-optimized --version
# Output: chunkhound 1.1.0
```

The binary now works on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS and all newer versions, resolving the GLIBC compatibility issue completely.
