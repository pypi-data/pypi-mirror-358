## üöÄ Installation

You can install this package using `pip`:

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bluorion-com/ZClip.git
```

### With PyTorch Lightning Support

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/bluorion-com/ZClip.git#egg=zclip[lightning]"
```

## üß† Algorithm Overview

ZClip is an adaptive gradient clipping technique designed to mitigate gradient spikes by tracking running statistics of gradient norms through Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). At each training step, it updates the mean and variance of the gradient norm without storing historical data, allowing it to respond quickly to shifts in training dynamics.

When the current gradient norm deviates significantly from recent trends, ZClip dynamically computes a clipping threshold based on the observed variance. This approach automatically suppresses unusually large gradient updates‚Äîoften the cause of loss spikes‚Äîwithout relying on fixed, manually-tuned thresholds.

By continuously adapting to the evolving scale and variability of gradients, ZClip ensures greater training stability and maintains learning efficiency, even under high learning rates or aggressive scheduling.

## üìö Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from zclip import ZClip

model = YourModel()  # Your PyTorch model
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Initialize ZClip
zclip = ZClip(alpha=0.97, z_thresh=2.5)

# Training loop
for batch in dataloader:
    # Forward and backward pass
    loss = model(batch)
    loss.backward()
    
    # Apply ZClip before optimizer step
    zclip.step(model)
    
    # Update weights
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### PyTorch Lightning (with optional dependency)

```python
from lightning import Trainer
from zclip import ZClipLightningCallback

# Create a Lightning Trainer with ZClip
trainer = Trainer(
    callbacks=[
        ZClipLightningCallback(alpha=0.97, z_thresh=2.5)
    ]
)

# Train your model
trainer.fit(model, dataloader)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

Our code is built within the PyTorch Lightning framework, utilizing its callback system for seamless integration into the training pipeline. It is fully compatible with FSDP and requires no code changes to work out of the box.

You can also use ZClip directly with standard PyTorch by calling `.step(model)` after `loss.backward()` and before `optimizer.step()`.

## üîç ZClip Parameters

| Argument        | Description                                                                                                                                         | Default            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `mode`          | Clipping mode. Options: <br> ‚Ä¢ `"zscore"` ‚Äì Uses z‚Äëscore based clipping. <br> ‚Ä¢ `"percentile"` ‚Äì Uses fixed threshold clipping defined as EMA mean plus (z_thresh √ó std). | `"zscore"`         |
| `z_thresh`      | Threshold value. In "zscore" mode, it sets the z‚Äëscore threshold; in "percentile" mode, it is used as the multiplier for std.                      | `2.5`              |
| `alpha`         | EMA smoothing factor for updating the gradient norm statistics.                                                                                    | `0.97`             |
| `clip_option`   | *(Only for "zscore" mode)* Clipping strategy: <br> ‚Ä¢ `"adaptive_scaling"` ‚Äì Compute an adaptive threshold if the z‚Äëscore is high. <br> ‚Ä¢ `"mean"` ‚Äì Clip to the EMA mean. | `"adaptive_scaling"` |
| `clip_factor`   | Constant Multiplier for the adaptive scaling threshold. A value between **0.5** and **0.9** yields more aggressive clipping, while a higher value (default `1.0`) is less aggressive. | `1.0`              |

## Aggressive Hyperparameter Settings

When training models with volatile gradients, noisy data, or when using curriculum learning strategies, more aggressive gradient clipping can be beneficial. In such scenarios, consider adjusting the following parameters:

- **`alpha`**:  
  The `alpha` parameter controls the smoothing of the EMA for gradient norm statistics. A lower value (e.g. around **0.90-0.95**) makes the EMA more responsive to recent gradients, which can be beneficial for rapidly changing gradient distributions. However, setting it too low might introduce noise into the EMA estimate, so it must be balanced carefully.

- **`z_thresh`**:  
  You may also consider reducing the `z_thresh` slightly (for example, from the default `2.5` to around **2.0**) to tighten the criteria for clipping further.

- **`clip_factor`**:  
  Lowering the `clip_factor` to a value between **0.5** and **0.9** will reduce the adaptive threshold in the `"adaptive_scaling"` mode, resulting in more aggressive clipping. This can help stabilize training by curbing large gradient spikes.

These settings are particularly useful in scenarios where the gradient distribution is highly dynamic. Adjust and monitor these hyperparameters based on your specific model, dataset, and training dynamics to achieve optimal performance.
