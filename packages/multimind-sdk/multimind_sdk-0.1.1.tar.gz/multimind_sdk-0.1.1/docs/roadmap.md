  - Configurable agents for specific tasks
  - YAML/CLI interfaces
  - Self-improving agent capabilities
- [ ] **Extensible Tools Framework** (tool registration + execution)
  - Tool selection optimization
  - Workflow automation
- [ ] **Advanced Memory Interfaces** (Redis, Chroma, Chained Memory)
- [ ] **Multi-call Chaining & Prompt Management**
- [ ] **End-to-End RAG Pipeline** (ingestion, indexing, optimization)
  - Hybrid retrieval models
  - Enhanced accuracy algorithms

## 🔜 Phase 3 – Target Q3 2025

- [ ] **Cognitive Loop Framework** (self-improving agents)
  - Agent collaboration capabilities
  - Hierarchical multi-agent systems
  - Advanced inter-agent communication
- [ ] **Zero/Low-Code YAML Pipeline Configs**
  - Visual workflow builder
  - Drag-and-drop components
- [ ] **Hybrid Search with Vector + Knowledge Graph**
- [ ] **Multilingual + Multimodal Support** (Whisper, BLIP, OCR)
- [ ] **Agent Profiler Dashboard** (logs, cost, metrics)
- [ ] **TensorFlow and PyTorch Integration**
  - Custom model integration
  - Fine-tuning capabilities
  - Support for CV and NLP models

## 🌐 Phase 4 – Enterprise & Edge Ready (Q4 2025)

- [ ] **Fine-Tuning Adapter Layer** (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT workflows)
  - AutoML for agent configuration
  - Self-configuring agent systems
- [ ] **Comprehensive Compliance Suite**
  - GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA support
  - PII Redaction
  - Data governance frameworks
  - Audit logging systems
- [ ] **Edge Deployment Toolkit** (Jetson, Pi, Offline mode)
  - Resource efficiency tools
  - Edge-specific optimizations
- [ ] **Enterprise Integration Hub**
  - Plugin System (Slack, Notion, Salesforce)
  - Database connectors (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
  - Real-time data integration (Kafka, MQTT)
- [ ] **Unified Visual Dashboard + Debugger**
  - Live state monitoring
  - Memory editing
  - Workflow visualization
  - Performance analytics

## 🧪 Phase 5 – Future Innovations (2026+)

- [ ] **Self-Tuning RAG Indexer** (auto-retrain with feedback)
- [ ] **Advanced Agent Ecosystems**
  - Cross-Agent Communication (A2A, ReAct)
  - Distributed deployment
  - Complex multi-agent coordination
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace Integration** (plug-n-play agents)
- [ ] **On-device Local Model Hub**
  - Cloud sync capabilities
  - Continuous model updates
  - Hugging Face integration
- [ ] **Visual Agent Builder Interface**
  - No-code development
  - Enterprise workflow templates
  - Industry-specific solutions

## 🔎 Competitive Differentiators

- Unified pipeline for Fine-Tuning + RAG + Agents
- YAML-first, no-code + SDK support
- Built-in compliance, monitoring, cost-control
- SDK-level KG + vector hybrid retrieval
- Edge-to-cloud agent deployment
