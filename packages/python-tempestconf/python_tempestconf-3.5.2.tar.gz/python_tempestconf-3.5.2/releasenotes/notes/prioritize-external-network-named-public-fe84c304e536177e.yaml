    python-tempestconf will prioritize the external network named public when
    auto-discovering an external network for tempest. The public network is
    the network we end up using in most of the cases. This will help avoid
    potential conflicts with other available external networks that are not
    meant to be used by tempest. If no external network with name public is
    found, the network discovered last will be used.
