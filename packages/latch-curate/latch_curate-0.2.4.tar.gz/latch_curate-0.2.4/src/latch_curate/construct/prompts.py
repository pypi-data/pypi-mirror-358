    ## CONTEXT

    You are operating inside a clean working directory that already contains:

    * **Raw data folder**: `data`
    * **Utility library**: `scrna_utils.py`  

    ---

    ## GOAL

    Write a single **driver script** called `build_anndata.py` that:

    1. **Organize** counts and metadata in per-sample folders, extracting or unzipping files as unnecessary.
    2. **Parses** each sampleâ€™s count + metadata files using *functions in `scrna_utils.py`* (import and monkey patch as needed)
    3. **Ensures** per-sample AnnData objects satisfy:  
       * `var` index = Ensembl IDs  
       * `var['gene_symbols']` present  
       * all author metadata columns prefixed with `author_`
    4. **Merges** the sample AnnData objects and identify distinct samples with an obs variable named "latch_sample_id". Prefix obs names with sample names to ensure uniqueness.
    5. **Writes** the combined object to `output.h5ad` (do **not** transform or QC the counts).
    6. **Validates** the combined object respects criteria in the ##Validation section.

    ---

    ## GUIDELINES

    * Try to use and monkey patch the helper functions already provided in
    `scrna_utils.py` for relevant components of workflow.
    * Try to match the author cell count provided in <paper_text> with the total cell count in your matrix
    * Try to use all of the relevant information in <paper_text> and <study_metadata> to help you with your task
    * The paper reports a total cell count around {target_cell_count}. Use this
    as a guideline, especially if you are below this value, as it indicates you
    should look for more data. NEVER downsample or drop raw data if you are
    above this target value.
    * Prioritize the information in <validation_failure>, if it exists. It
    contains failed validation tests that check the criteria in ## VALIDATION
    from your last attempt to perform this task.
    ---

    ## VALIDATION


    Validate the following in the constructed AnnData object:

    - there is an obs variable named 'latch_sample_id'
    - the var index is ensembl ids
    - there is a var variable named 'gene_symbols' with the symbols
    - the obs index, var index and var 'gene_symbols' contain unique values'
    - the counts are raw/not transformed (eg. negative, not integers, etc.)
    - the number of rows roughly matches the cell count described in <paper_text>
    - any additional obs variables (eg. `author_` prefixed) have realistic values and not `nan` or similar
    - the count matrix is written to a file named `output.h5ad`
    - there is subject-level metadata available somewhere (if not in `latch_sample_id` then some author variable)

    ## STRICT CONSTRAINTS

    * **Do not** normalise, log-transform, or filter the counts.  
    * Under **no circumstances** should the script subset, sample, or
    downsample the raw data.  It must load every barcode and every nonzero
    count value.

    After you finish writing build_anndata.py, execute it with "python build_anndata.py" and do not exit until the file output.h5ad exists.
