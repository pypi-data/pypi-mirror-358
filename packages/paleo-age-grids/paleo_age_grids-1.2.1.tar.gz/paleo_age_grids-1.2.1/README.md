# paleo-age-grids

This is a fork of the repo by Simon Williams et al. related to the scientific article called ["Reconstructing seafloor age distributions in lost ocean basins"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.06.004), that has been modified to be integrated into [Terra Antiqua](https://github.com/LucasAmion/terra-antiqua), a plugin for the QGIS software.
