CERC Persistence consist of a set of classes to store and retrieve Cerc Hub cities and results.

Developed at Concordia university in Canada as part of the research group from the Next Generation Cities Institute, our aim among others is to provide a comprehensive set of tools to help researchers and urban developers to make decisions to improve the livability and efficiency of our cities, cerc persistence will store the simulation results and city information to make those available for other researchers.
