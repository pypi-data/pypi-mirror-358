class BaseActivityLogs(BaseModel):
    """
    Base model representing an email activity log entry in the Naxai email system.
    
    This class defines the core structure for email activity data, providing essential
    information about an email's routing, status, and engagement metrics. It serves as
    the foundation for more specialized activity log models.
    
    Attributes:
        message_id (str): Unique identifier for the email message.
            Mapped from JSON key 'messageId'.
        from_email (str): The sender's email address.
            Mapped from JSON key 'fromEmail'.
        to_email (str): The recipient's email address.
            Mapped from JSON key 'toEmail'.
        subject (Optional[str]): The subject line of the email.
            May be None if not available or not provided.
        status (Optional[Literal["sent", "delivered", "failed"]]): 
            Current delivery status of the email.
            - "sent": Email has been sent but delivery confirmation is pending
            - "delivered": Email has been successfully delivered to the recipient's inbox
            - "failed": Email delivery has failed
            - "processed": Email was processed
            May be None if the status is unknown or not provided.
        created_at (Optional[int]): 
            Timestamp when the email was created/sent, in milliseconds since epoch.
            Mapped from JSON key 'createdAt'. May be None if not available.
        updated_at (Optional[int]): 
            Timestamp when the email status was last updated, in milliseconds since epoch.
            Mapped from JSON key 'updatedAt'. May be None if not available.
        opens (Optional[int]): Number of times the email has been opened by the recipient.
            May be None if not available or not tracked.
        clicks (Optional[int]): 
            Number of times links within the email have been clicked by the recipient.
            May be None if not available or not tracked.
    
    Example:
        >>> activity = BaseActivityLogs(
        ...     messageId="msg_123abc456def",

        >>> print(f"Status: {activity.status}")
        >>> print(f"Sent at: {activity.created_at}")

        Message ID: msg_123abc456def
        From: sender@example.com to: recipient@example.com
        Subject: Important Update
        Status: delivered
        Sent at: 1703066400000
        Engagement: 3 opens, 2 clicks
        
        >>> # Calculate time to delivery
        >>> if activity.created_at and activity.updated_at and activity.status == "delivered":
        ...     delivery_time = activity.updated_at - activity.created_at
        ...     print(f"Time to delivery: {delivery_time} ms")
        Time to delivery: 100000 ms
    
    Note:
        - This class supports both alias-based and direct field name access through populate_by_name
        - It serves as a base class for more specialized activity log models
        - The message_id is the primary identifier for tracking and querying emails
        - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are in milliseconds since epoch
        - The opens and clicks fields provide basic engagement metrics
        - For detailed event history, use the GetEmailActivityLogsResponse class
        - Email status progression typically follows: sent -> delivered or failed

    Note:
        - All fields are optional as they may not be included in all API responses
        - Common event names include:
          * "sent": Email has been accepted for delivery
          * "delivered": Email has been delivered to the recipient's inbox
          * "opened": Recipient has opened the email
          * "clicked": Recipient has clicked a link in the email
          * "failed": Email delivery has failed

          * "complained": Recipient has marked the email as spam
          * "unsubscribed": Recipient has unsubscribed from future emails
        - The processed timestamp format may vary depending on the API version
        - The reason field is particularly important for diagnosing delivery issues

class ListEmailActivityLogsResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    Model representing a paginated list of email activity logs in the Naxai email system.
