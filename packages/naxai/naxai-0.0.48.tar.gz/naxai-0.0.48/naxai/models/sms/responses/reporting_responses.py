    Model representing time-based incoming SMS metrics in the Naxai messaging system.
    
    This class extends BaseResponse to provide metrics about incoming SMS messages,
    grouped by hour, day, or month. It includes statistics about received message
    volumes for the specified time period.
    
    Attributes:
        direction (Literal["incoming"]): Indicates that these metrics are for incoming messages.
        group (Literal["hour", "day", "month"]): The time interval grouping used for the metrics.
        stats (list[IncomingStats]): List of statistics entries, each representing metrics
            for a specific time interval within the overall period.
            
        # Inherited from BaseResponse:
        start_date (str): The beginning of the time period for these metrics.
        stop_date (str): The end of the time period for these metrics.
    
    Example:
        >>> response = ListIncomingSMSMetricsResponse(
        ...     startDate="2023-01-01",
        ...     stopDate="2023-01-31",
        ...     direction="incoming",
        ...     group="day",
        ...     stats=[
        ...         IncomingStats(date="2023-01-01", sms=120),
        ...         IncomingStats(date="2023-01-02", sms=145),
        ...         IncomingStats(date="2023-01-03", sms=135)
        ...     ]
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Period: {response.start_date} to {response.stop_date}")
        >>> print(f"Grouping: {response.group}")
        >>> print(f"Total incoming SMS: {sum(day.sms for day in response.stats)}")
        Period: 2023-01-01 to 2023-01-31
        Grouping: day
        Total incoming SMS: 400
    
    Note:
        - The stats list contains entries corresponding to the specified grouping level
        - For hour grouping: One entry per hour in the date range
        - For day grouping: One entry per day in the date range
        - For month grouping: One entry per month in the date range
        - Incoming metrics are simpler than outgoing metrics as they only track volume

class ListDeliveryErrorMetricsResponse(BaseResponse):
    """
    Model representing SMS delivery error metrics in the Naxai messaging system.
    
    This class extends BaseResponse to provide detailed metrics about SMS delivery errors,
    grouped by error category and code. It includes statistics about the frequency of
    different error types during the specified time period.
    
    Attributes:
        stats (list[DeliveryErrorStats]): List of statistics entries, each representing metrics
            for a specific error category and code within the overall period.
            
        # Inherited from BaseResponse:
        start_date (str): The beginning of the time period for these metrics.

        handset: 28 errors
        network: 17 errors
    
    Note:
        - The stats list contains one entry per unique error category and code combination
        - Error categories typically include "carrier", "handset", "network", etc.
        - Error codes provide specific information about what went wrong
        - These metrics help identify common delivery issues and their relative frequency
