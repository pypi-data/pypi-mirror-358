        Send a transactional email to one or more recipients.
        
        This method provides a simplified interface for sending transactional emails such as
        account notifications, password resets, order confirmations, and other event-triggered
        communications. It accepts individual parameters rather than requiring a complete
        SendTransactionalEmailModel object.
        
        Args:
            sender_email (str): 
                The email address of the sender. Must be a verified sender in your account.
            sender_name (str): The display name of the sender that appears in email clients.
            subject (str): The subject line of the email.
            to (List[DestinationObject]): 
                List of primary recipients, each containing email and optional name.
                Must include at least 1 recipient, maximum 1000 recipients.
                Example: [{"email": "recipient@example.com", "name": "Recipient Name"}]
            cc (Optional[List[DestinationObject]]): 
                List of CC (carbon copy) recipients, each containing
                email and optional name. Maximum 50 recipients. Defaults to None.
            bcc (Optional[List[DestinationObject]]): 
                List of BCC (blind carbon copy) recipients, each containing
                email and optional name. Maximum 50 recipients. Defaults to None.
            reply_to (Optional[str]): 
                Email address that will receive replies if recipients reply to the email.
                Defaults to None (replies go to sender_email).
            text (Optional[str]): 
                Plain text version of the email content. At least one of text or html
                must be provided. Defaults to None.
            html (Optional[str]): HTML version of the email content. At least one of text or html
                must be provided. Defaults to None.
            attachments (List[Attachment]): List of file attachments to include with the email.
                Each attachment should include filename, content_type, and content (base64 encoded).
                Defaults to None.
            enable_tracking (Optional[bool]): 
                Whether to enable open and click tracking for this email.
                Defaults to None (system default setting is used).
        
        Returns:
            SendTransactionalEmailResponse: A response object containing the unique identifier
            for the sent email.
                This ID can be used for tracking and querying the email's status.
        
        Raises:
            NaxaiAPIRequestError: If the API request fails due to invalid parameters
            or server issues
            NaxaiAuthenticationError: If authentication fails
            NaxaiAuthorizationError: If the account lacks permission to send emails
            NaxaiRateLimitExceeded: If the rate limit for sending emails is exceeded
            ValidationError: If the provided parameters fail validation

        Note:
            - At least one of text or html must be provided
            - The sender_email must be a verified sender in your Naxai account
            - For high deliverability, ensure your sender domain is properly configured with
              SPF and DKIM
            - This method is a convenience wrapper around the transactional.send() method
            - For more advanced options like templates, tags, or custom headers, use 
              transactional.send() directly
            - Attachments should be kept reasonably sized to avoid delivery issues
            - The total size of all attachments should not exceed 10MB
