"""
Voice broadcast resource for the Naxai SDK.

This module provides methods for creating and managing voice broadcast campaigns,
including creating, retrieving, updating, and controlling broadcasts. It supports
operations such as starting, pausing, resuming, and canceling broadcasts, as well
as accessing detailed metrics and recipient information through specialized
sub-resources.

    update(broadcast_id: str, request: UpdateBroadcastRequest)
        Updates an existing broadcast's configuration.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to update
            request: Updated broadcast configuration
        Returns:
            UpdateBroadcastResponse: Updated broadcast details

    start(broadcast_id: str)
        Starts a broadcast campaign.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to start
        Returns:
            StartBroadcastResponse: Start operation result

    pause(broadcast_id: str)
        Pauses an active broadcast campaign.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to pause
        Returns:
            PauseBroadcastResponse: Pause operation result

    resume(broadcast_id: str)
        Resumes a paused broadcast campaign.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to resume
        Returns:
            ResumeBroadcastResponse: Resume operation result

    cancel(broadcast_id: str)
        Cancels an active or paused broadcast campaign.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to cancel
        Returns:
            CancelBroadcastResponse: Cancel operation result

Sub-resources:
    metrics:
        A subresource for retrieving broadcast metrics and analytics.
        See MetricsResource for detailed documentation.

    recipients:
        A subresource for managing broadcast recipients and tracking delivery.
        See RecipientsResource for detailed documentation.
