        Retrieve comprehensive email engagement metrics from the Naxai email system.
        
        This method fetches detailed statistics about email performance, including delivery rates,
        open rates, click rates, and negative metrics such as bounces and complaints. The data
        can be filtered by time period and grouped by day or month to analyze trends over
        time.
        
        Args:
            start (Optional[int]): Start timestamp for the reporting period, in seconds since epoch.
                Defaults to 7 days ago from the current time.
            stop (Optional[int]): End timestamp for the reporting period, in seconds since epoch.
                Defaults to the current time.
            group (Optional[Literal["day", "month"]]): The time interval grouping for the metrics.
                - "day": Group metrics by day (default)
                - "month": Group metrics by month
        
        Returns:

        Note:
            - The start and stop timestamps are provided in seconds since epoch but converted to
              milliseconds in the response
            - The default time range is the past 7 days if no parameters are provided
            - Key engagement metrics to monitor include:
              * Delivery rate: delivered / sent
              * Open rate: opened_unique / delivered
              * Click rate: clicked_unique / delivered
              * Click-to-open rate: clicked_unique / opened_unique
            - Key negative metrics to monitor include:
              * Bounce rate: bounced / sent
              * Complaint rate: complained / sent
              * Unsubscribe rate: unsubscribed / delivered
            - High bounce or complaint rates may indicate issues with email quality or 
              recipient targeting
            - The date field in each stats entry is in milliseconds since epoch and represents the
              start of that time interval (day or month)
            - For more detailed click metrics by URL, use the clicked_urls.list() method
            - For best results, use a time range that matches your email sending frequency
