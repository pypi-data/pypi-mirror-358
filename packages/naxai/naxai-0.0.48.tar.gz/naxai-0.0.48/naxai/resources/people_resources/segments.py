"""
Contact segments resource for the Naxai People SDK.

This module provides methods for managing contact segments in the Naxai platform,
including creating, retrieving, updating, and analyzing segments of contacts based
on various criteria. It supports both manual segments (explicitly defined members)
and dynamic segments (rule-based membership), and provides tools for tracking
segment membership changes over time.

        Args:
            segment_id (str): The unique identifier of the segment to delete.
        Returns:
            None

            the initial calculation of segment membership is complete

            - For dynamic segments, changes reflect contacts that started or stopped meeting

        Retrieve information about where a segment is being used in the Naxai People API.
        
        This method fetches data about which campaigns and broadcasts are using the
        specified segment. This information is valuable when considering segment modifications
        or deletion, as it helps identify potential impacts on active communications.
        
        Args:
            segment_id (str): The unique identifier of the segment to check usage for.
        
        Returns:
            GetSegmentUsageResponse: A response object containing lists of campaign IDs
                and broadcast IDs that use this segment.
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: If segment_id is empty.
            NaxaiAPIRequestError: If there is an error response from the API.
            NaxaiAuthenticationError: If authentication fails.
            NaxaiAuthorizationError: If the account lacks permission to access segment information.
            NaxaiResourceNotFound: If the specified segment does not exist.
        
        Example:
            ```python
            with NaxaiClient(api_client_id="your_id", api_client_secret="your_secret") as client:
                try:

                    segment = client.people.segments.get(segment_id=segment_id)

        Note:
            - This method is particularly useful before modifying or deleting a segment
            - For dynamic segments, changing conditions will affect all campaigns and broadcasts
            that use the segment
            - For manual segments, adding or removing contacts will immediately affect
            any active campaigns or broadcasts using the segment
            - If a segment is in use, consider creating a new segment instead of modifying
            an existing one to avoid disrupting active communications
            - The response includes only the IDs of campaigns and broadcasts; to get detailed
            information about them, you would need to make additional API calls
