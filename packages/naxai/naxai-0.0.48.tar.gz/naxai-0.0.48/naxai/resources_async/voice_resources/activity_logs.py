"""
Asynchronous voice activity logs resource for the Naxai SDK.

This module provides asynchronous methods for retrieving and analyzing detailed voice call logs,
including listing calls with various filtering options and retrieving comprehensive information
about specific calls. These logs contain data about call routing, duration, status, and other
attributes for inbound, outbound, and transferred calls, accessible in a non-blocking manner
suitable for high-performance asynchronous applications.

Available Functions:
    list(page=1, page_size=25, start=None, stop=None, direction=None, status=None,
         from_=None, to=None, client_id=None, campaign_id=None, broadcast_id=None)
        Retrieves a paginated list of voice call activity logs with optional filtering.
        Args:
            page: Page number to retrieve (default: 1)
            page_size: Number of items per page (default: 25, max: 100)
            start: Start timestamp in milliseconds since epoch
            stop: End timestamp in milliseconds since epoch
            direction: Filter by call direction ("inbound", "outbound", "transfer")
            status: Filter by call status ("delivered", "failed")
            from_: Filter by originating phone number
            to: Filter by destination phone number
            client_id: Filter by client identifier
            campaign_id: Filter by campaign identifier
            broadcast_id: Filter by broadcast identifier
        Returns:
            ListActivityLogsResponse: List of call logs with pagination info

    get(call_id: str)
        Retrieves detailed information about a specific call.
        Args:
            call_id: ID of the call to retrieve
        Returns:
            GetActivityLogResponse: Detailed call information

        Args:
            page (Optional[int]): Page number to retrieve. Defaults to 1.
            page_size (Optional[int]): Number of items per page (1-100). Defaults to 25.
            start (Optional[int]): Start timestamp for filtering calls, in milliseconds since epoch.
            stop (Optional[int]): End timestamp for filtering calls, in milliseconds since epoch.
