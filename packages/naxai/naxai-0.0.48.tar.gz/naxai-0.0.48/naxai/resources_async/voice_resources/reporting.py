"""
Asynchronous voice reporting resource for the Naxai SDK.

This module serves as a container for specialized asynchronous voice call reporting resources,
providing access to comprehensive metrics and analytics for different call types. It includes
resources for analyzing outbound calls, inbound calls, and call transfers, enabling users to
monitor and optimize their voice communication performance in a non-blocking manner suitable
for high-performance asynchronous applications.

Sub-resources:
    outbound:
        A subresource for retrieving and analyzing outbound call metrics.
        Provides methods for analyzing call volumes, delivery rates, and geographical distribution.
        See OutboundResource for detailed documentation.

    inbound:
        A subresource for retrieving and analyzing inbound call metrics.
        Provides methods for analyzing incoming call patterns and handling statistics.
        See InboundResource for detailed documentation.

    transfer:
        A subresource for retrieving and analyzing transferred call metrics.
        Provides methods for analyzing call transfer volumes, success rates, and durations.
        See TransferResource for detailed documentation.
