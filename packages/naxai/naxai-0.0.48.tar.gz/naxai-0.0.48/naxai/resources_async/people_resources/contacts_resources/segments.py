"""
Asynchronous contact segments resource for the Naxai People SDK.

This module provides asynchronous methods for retrieving segment memberships for
individual contacts in the Naxai platform. It allows users to determine which
segments a specific contact belongs to in a non-blocking manner, which is useful
for understanding how contacts are categorized and which targeted communications
they may receive in high-performance asynchronous applications.

Available Functions:
    list(identifier: str)
        Retrieves all segments that a specific contact belongs to.
        Args:
            identifier (str): Contact's unique identifier (ID, email, phone, or external ID)
        Returns:
            ListSegmentsOfContactResponse: List of segments the contact belongs to

        Retrieve all segments that a specific contact belongs to in the Naxai People API.
        
        This method fetches the complete list of segments that the specified contact is a member of.
        This information is useful for understanding how a contact is categorized within your
        segmentation strategy and which targeted communications they may receive.
        
        Args:
            identifier (str): The unique identifier of the contact. This can be the Naxai ID,
                email address, phone number, or external ID depending on your account's
                primary identifier configuration.
        
        Returns:
            ListSegmentsOfContactResponse: A response object containing the list of segments
                that the contact belongs to. Each segment object includes basic information
                such as ID, name, description, and type.
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: If the identifier is empty or invalid.
            NaxaiAPIRequestError: If there is an error response from the API.
            NaxaiAuthenticationError: If authentication fails.
            NaxaiAuthorizationError: If the account lacks permission to access segment information.
            NaxaiResourceNotFound: If the specified contact does not exist.
        
        Example:
            ```python
            async with NaxaiAsyncClient(api_client_id="your_id",
                                        api_client_secret="your_secret") as client:
                # Get all segments for a specific contact
                contact_id = "john.doe@example.com"  # Using email as identifier
                response = await client.people.contacts.segments.list(identifier=contact_id)
                
                # Display the segments the contact belongs to
                print(f"Contact {contact_id} belongs to {len(response.segments)} segments:")
                
                for segment in response.segments:
                    segment_type = "Manual" if segment.type_ == "manual" else "Dynamic"
                    print(f"- {segment.name} (ID: {segment.id}, Type: {segment_type})")
                    if segment.description:
                        print(f"  Description: {segment.description}")
                
                # Check if the contact is in a specific segment
                target_segment_id = "seg_123abc"
                is_in_segment = any(segment.id == target_segment_id
                                     for segment in response.segments)
                print(f"Contact is in target segment: {is_in_segment}")
            ```
        
        Note:
            - This method returns only basic segment information
            - For detailed segment definitions including conditions, use the dedicated segment API
            - An empty list indicates the contact doesn't belong to any segments
            - Segment membership can change over time as contacts' attributes and behaviors evolve
            - For dynamic segments, membership is recalculated periodically based
              on the segment conditions
