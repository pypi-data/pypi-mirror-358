"""
Asynchronous segment contacts resource for the Naxai People SDK.

This module provides asynchronous methods for managing contacts within segments in the
Naxai platform, including adding and removing contacts from manual segments, counting
segment members, and retrieving contacts that belong to specific segments. These
operations are essential for targeted audience management and campaign planning in
high-performance asynchronous applications.

Available Functions:
    add(segment_id: str, contact_ids: list[str])
        Add contacts to a manual segment.
        
    delete(segment_id: str, contact_ids: list[str]) 
        Remove contacts from a manual segment.
        
    count(segment_id: str) -> CountContactsInSegmentResponse
        Count the number of contacts in a segment.
        
    list(segment_id: str, page: Optional[int], size: Optional[int]) -> ListContactsOfSegmentResponse
        List contacts that belong to a segment with pagination support.

        Add contacts to a manual segment in the Naxai People API.
        
        This method allows you to add one or more contacts to a manual segment by their IDs.
        This operation is only applicable to manual segments; dynamic segments automatically
        include contacts based on their defined conditions.
        
        Args:
            segment_id (str): The unique identifier of the segment to add contacts to.
            contact_ids (list[str]): A list of contact IDs to add to the segment.
                Must contain at least one ID.
            examples:
                nxid:
                value: "nxid_{contact_id}"
                phone:

        Returns:
            None
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: If segment_id is empty or contact_ids is empty.
            NaxaiAPIRequestError: If there is an error response from the API.
            NaxaiAuthenticationError: If authentication fails.
            NaxaiAuthorizationError: If the account lacks permission to modify segments.
            NaxaiResourceNotFound: If the specified segment or any of the contacts do not exist.
            NaxaiInvalidRequestError: If the segment is not a manual segment.
        
        Example:
            ```python

                                        api_client_secret="your_secret") as client:

        Note:
            - This method only works with manual segments
            - For dynamic segments, contacts are automatically included based on segment conditions
            - All contacts must exist in your account before they can be added to a segment
            - If a contact is already in the segment, adding it again has no effect
            - This operation is idempotent - calling it multiple times with the same parameters
            will not result in duplicate contacts in the segment
