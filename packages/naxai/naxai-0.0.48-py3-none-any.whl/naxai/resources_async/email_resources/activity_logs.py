"""
Asynchronous email activity logs resource for the Naxai SDK.

This module provides asynchronous methods for retrieving and analyzing email activity logs,
including delivery status, engagement metrics, and event history for individual messages
and across multiple emails. It enables non-blocking access to detailed email tracking data,
allowing applications to efficiently monitor email performance and recipient interactions
without impacting application responsiveness.

Available Functions:
    get(message_id: str, email: str)
        Retrieve detailed activity logs for a specific email message sent to a particular recipient.
        Returns comprehensive information about delivery status, engagement metrics and event
        history.

    list(email: str, status: Optional[str] = None, page: int = 1, limit: int = 10)
        List activity logs for multiple email messages sent to a recipient.
        Returns paginated results with basic delivery and engagement information.

            message_id (str): Unique identifier of the email message to retrieve.
                This ID is typically obtained from the response when sending an email
                or from the list() method results.
            email (str): The recipient's email address for which to retrieve activity data.
                This must match the email address the message was sent to.

        Note:
            - Both message_id and email parameters are required to uniquely identify
              the email activity
            - The message_id is typically obtained from the response when sending an email or
              from list() results
            - The email parameter must match the recipient's email address the message was sent to
            - The events list provides a chronological history of the email's journey and
              recipient interactions
            - Common event types include:
            * "sent": Email has been accepted for delivery
            * "delivered": Email has been delivered to the recipient's inbox
            * "opened": Recipient has opened the email
            * "clicked": Recipient has clicked a link in the email
            * "failed": Email delivery has failed
            * "bounced": Email has bounced from the recipient's server
            * "complained": Recipient has marked the email as spam
            * "unsubscribed": Recipient has unsubscribed from future emails
            - Timestamps in the response (created_at, updated_at) are in milliseconds since epoch
            - Event timestamps (in the events list) may use a different format, typically ISO 8601
            - Email tracking (opens, clicks) requires proper configuration of tracking domains
