"""
Asynchronous voice broadcast recipients resource for the Naxai SDK.

This module provides asynchronous methods for managing and analyzing recipients of voice
broadcast campaigns, including listing recipients with various filtering options and
retrieving detailed information about specific recipients. It also serves as a container
for more specialized recipient resources such as call tracking, helping users understand
delivery outcomes and recipient engagement in a non-blocking manner suitable for
high-performance asynchronous applications.

Available Functions:
    list(broadcast_id: str, page=1, page_size=25, phone=None, completed=None, status=None)
        Retrieves a paginated list of recipients for a voice broadcast with optional filtering.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast to get recipients for
            page: Page number to retrieve (default: 1)
            page_size: Number of items per page (default: 25, max: 100)
            phone: Filter by recipient phone number
            completed: Filter by completion status
            status: Filter by delivery status
        Returns:
            ListBroadcastRecipientsResponse: List of recipients with pagination info

    get(broadcast_id: str, recipient_id: str)
        Retrieves detailed information about a specific recipient.
        Args:
            broadcast_id: ID of the broadcast
            recipient_id: ID of the recipient
        Returns:
            GetBroadcastRecipientResponse: Detailed recipient information

Sub-resources:
    calls:
        A subresource for tracking call attempts made to recipients.
        See CallsResource for detailed documentation.
