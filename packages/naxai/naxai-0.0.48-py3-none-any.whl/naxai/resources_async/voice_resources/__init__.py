"""
Asynchronous voice resources package for the Naxai SDK.

This package provides access to asynchronous voice communication resources including:
- Call: For managing individual voice calls and call operations
- Broadcast: For creating and managing voice broadcast campaigns
- Reporting: For analyzing voice call metrics and performance data
- Activity logs: For tracking detailed voice call events and outcomes

These resources enable non-blocking access to voice functionality, allowing for
efficient voice operations in high-performance asynchronous applications.
