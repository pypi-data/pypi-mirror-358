This module aims to materialize the triggering of another stock rule through
an orderpoint in the procurement of MTO products.

The MTO route will loose it's MTO rule as this is replaced by the generated orderpoints.
When a product is configured as MTO, then an orderpoint with min/max of zero is created.
When the product is not anymore configured as MTO, the orderpoint can be automatically archived depending on the configuration you choose on the warehouse.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
