# hg-setup: easily setup Mercurial with a tiny Python application

hg-setup can be used to setup [Mercurial]. The main command provided by this package,
`hg-setup init`, launches a simple Terminal User Interface (TUI) to initialize a
reasonable user configuration file and shell completion for bash and zsh.

With [UV], one can even run it without installation with:

```sh
uvx hg-setup init
```

## Background

[Mercurial] is a Python application using C and Rust extensions. It is extendable with
Mercurial extensions and two Python packages provide very useful Mercurial extensions
that most users should use : [hg-git] (Mercurial extension `hggit`) and [hg-evolve]
(Mercurial extensions `topic` and `evolve`).

These things are packaged in 3 PyPI packages (associated with their equivalent
conda-forge packages): mercurial, hg-git, hg-evolve. Moreover, to use Mercurial
extensions, one has to write few lines in a configuration file (`~/.hgrc`).

Mercurial with hg-git and hg-evolve is great but it is a bit difficult to setup for
beginners. hg-setup is there to help people to start with Mercurial and finalize its
installation.

## Install

Here, we give commands to install in two isolated environment on one side Mercurial and
its more useful extensions ([hg-git] and [hg-evolve]) and on the other side hg-setup.

### From the package on PyPI

- With [pipx]

```sh
pipx install mercurial
pipx inject mercurial hg-git hg-evolve
pipx install hg-setup
```

- With [UV]

```sh
uv tool install mercurial --with hg-git --with hg-evolve
uv tool install hg-setup
```

### From the conda-forge package

- with [Miniforge] and [conda-app]

```sh
conda activate base
pip install conda-app
conda-app install mercurial
conda-app install hg-setup
```

- With [Pixi]

```sh
pixi global install mercurial --with hg-git --with hg-evolve
# and then
pixi global install hg-setup
```

### From source

```sh
pipx install hg-setup@hg+https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/hg-setup
```

For development installation, see the file [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## User interfaces

The `~/.hgrc` file and shell completion for bash and zsh can be initialized with a simple
Terminal User Interface (TUI):

```sh
hg-setup init
```

We can also avoid the TUI with

```sh
hg-setup init --name "Alice Lastname" --email alice.lastname@proton.me --auto
```

The shell completion for bash and zsh can be initialized with:

```sh
hg-setup init-shell-completion bash
hg-setup init-shell-completion zsh
```
