The GLHMM toolbox provides facilities to fit a variety of Hidden Markov models (HMM) based on the Gaussian distribution, which we generalise as the Gaussian-Linear HMM. 
Crucially, the toolbox has a focus on finding associations at various levels between brain data (EEG, MEG, fMRI, ECoG, etc) and non-brain data, such as behavioural or physiological variables.
