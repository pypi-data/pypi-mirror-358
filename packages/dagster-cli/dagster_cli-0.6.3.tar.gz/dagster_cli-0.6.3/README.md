# Dagster CLI (dgc)

A command-line interface for Dagster+, inspired by GitHub's `gh` CLI.

## Installation

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended - adds 'dgc' to PATH)
uv tool install dagster-cli

# Or run without installation (temporary use)
uvx --from dagster-cli dgc auth login

# Or install with pip
pip install dagster-cli

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dagster-cli.git
cd dagster-cli
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with your Dagster+ deployment
dgc auth login
# Enter your Dagster+ URL: your-org.dagster.cloud/prod
# Enter your User Token: (from Organization Settings â†’ Tokens)

# 2. Start using dgc
dgc job list                    # List all jobs
dgc run list --status FAILURE   # View failed runs
dgc asset health                # Check asset health

# 3. Access branch deployments
dgc run view abc123 --deployment feat-xyz  # Debug branch deployment
```

## Common Commands

### Authentication & Profiles
```bash
dgc auth login                  # Initial setup
dgc auth status                 # View current profile
dgc auth switch production      # Change profile
```

### Jobs & Runs
```bash
dgc job list                    # List all jobs
dgc job run my_job              # Submit a job
dgc job run my_job --config '{...}'  # Run with config

dgc run list                    # Recent runs
dgc run list --status FAILURE   # Failed runs only
dgc run view abc123             # Run details
dgc run logs abc123             # View run logs (events + auto stderr on errors)
dgc run logs abc123 --stdout    # View stdout logs
dgc run logs abc123 --stderr    # View stderr logs
```

### Assets
```bash
dgc asset list                  # All assets
dgc asset view my_asset         # View details with dependencies & dependents
dgc asset health                # Check health status
dgc asset materialize my_asset  # Trigger materialization
```

### Repository Management
```bash
dgc repo list                   # List locations
dgc repo reload my_location     # Reload code
```

### Deployment Management
```bash
dgc deployment list             # List all available deployments
dgc deployment test staging     # Test if deployment is accessible

# Example output:
# NAME                                 TYPE        STATUS    ID
# prod                                 Production  ACTIVE    12345
# staging                              Staging     ACTIVE    23456  
# feat/new-feature (abc123...)         Branch      ACTIVE    34567
# fix/bug-123 (def456...) PR #42      Branch      ACTIVE    45678
```

### Working with Deployments

#### Discovering Deployments
List all available deployments in your Dagster+ organization:

```bash
dgc deployment list             # Shows all deployments with type and status
```

Branch deployments are automatically created from git branches and shown with their commit SHA.

#### Accessing Deployments
Use the `--deployment` flag to access any deployment:

```bash
# Default: production deployment
dgc run list                    # Uses prod deployment

# Access branch deployment by commit SHA (use full SHA from deployment list)
dgc run view abc123 --deployment def456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789a

# Access named deployments
dgc job list --deployment staging
dgc asset health --deployment dev

# Test if a deployment exists
dgc deployment test feat-new-feature
```

The `--deployment` flag is available on all commands that interact with Dagster+:
- `dgc run list/view/logs`
- `dgc job list/view/run`
- `dgc asset list/view/health/materialize`
- `dgc repo list/reload`
- `dgc status`

## Configuration

### Multiple Profiles
```bash
dgc auth login --profile staging    # Create new profile
dgc job list --profile production   # Use specific profile
dgc auth switch staging             # Set default profile
```

### Environment Variables
- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_TOKEN` - User token
- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_URL` - Deployment URL
- `DGC_PROFILE` - Default profile
- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT` - Default deployment (if not using --deployment flag)

Credentials stored in `~/.config/dagster-cli/config.json` (permissions: 600)

## Output Options

Use `--json` flag for scripting:
```bash
# Filter jobs by name
dgc job list --json | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("etl"))'

# Submit job and get run ID
RUN_ID=$(dgc job run my_etl_job --json | jq -r '.run_id')
```

## AI Assistant Integration (MCP)

Enable AI assistants to monitor and debug your Dagster+ deployment:

```bash
# Start MCP server for local AI assistants
dgc mcp start

# For Claude Desktop, add to config:
{
  "servers": {
    "dagster-cli": {
      "command": "dgc",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Common AI use cases:
- "Check which assets are failing and need attention"
- "Why did the daily_revenue job fail yesterday?"
- "Show me the error logs for the failed ETL job"
- "Get the stderr output from run abc123"
- "Materialize all stale marketing assets"

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format and lint
make fix

# Build package
uv build
```
