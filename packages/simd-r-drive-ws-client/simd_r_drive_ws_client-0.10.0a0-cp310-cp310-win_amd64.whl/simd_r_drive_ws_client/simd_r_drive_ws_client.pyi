class NamespaceHasher:
    """
    A utility for generating namespaced keys using XXH3 hashing.

    `NamespaceHasher` ensures that keys are uniquely scoped to a given namespace
    by combining separate hashes of the namespace and the key. This avoids
    accidental collisions across logical domains (e.g., "opt:foo" vs "sys:foo").

    The final namespaced key is a fixed-length 16-byte identifier:
    8 bytes for the namespace hash + 8 bytes for the key hash.

     Example:
        >>> hasher = NamespaceHasher(b"users")
        >>> key = hasher.namespace(b"user123")
        >>> assert len(key) == 16
    """

    def __init__(self, prefix: bytes) -> None:
        """
        Initializes the `NamespaceHasher` with a namespace prefix.

        The prefix is hashed once using XXH3 to serve as a unique identifier for
        the namespace. All keys passed to `namespace()` will be scoped to this
        prefix.

        Args:
            prefix (bytes): A byte string that represents the namespace prefix.

    def namespace(self, key: bytes) -> bytes:
        """
        Returns a 16-byte namespaced key based on the given input key.

        The output is constructed by concatenating the namespace hash and the
        hash of the key:
            - First 8 bytes: XXH3 hash of the namespace prefix.
            - Next 8 bytes: XXH3 hash of the key.

        This design ensures deterministic and collision-isolated key derivation.

        Args:
            key (bytes): The key to hash within the current namespace.

        Returns:
            bytes: A 16-byte namespaced key (`prefix_hash || key_hash`).
