# AI Software Development Kit

AI Software Development Kit is a Python library that allows you to create, package, and test AI inference pipelines for the
AI Inference Server. The AI SDK is accompanied by project templates that provide notebook-based workflows for training models,
packaging them for deployment and testing these packages.

Some of the AI SDK functionalities require pip version 21.3.1 or greater, so installing the library will upgrade your pip in the given Python environment.
