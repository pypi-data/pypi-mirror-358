        host: str = "http://localhost:11434",  # Your Ollama server
        model: str = "llama3.2:latest",        # Your preferred model
        stream: bool = True                    # Enable streaming
    ):
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"LLM connection failed"**:
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if model is available: `ollama list`
