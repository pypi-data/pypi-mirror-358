This is a plugin pack for the `render-engine` static site generator. It currently includes the
following plugins:

- [`LatestEntries`](#latestentries)
- [`NextPrevPlugin`](#nextprevplugin)
- [`Drafts`](#drafts)
- [`DateNormalizer`](#datenormalizer)

## Installation

To install just run:

```shell
pip install re-plugin-pack
```

Once installed you can access the plugins by importing `re_plugin_pack`:

```python
import re_plugin_pack
from re_plugin_pack import <plugin>
```

## `LatestEntries`

This plugin will add a list of the latest entries for one or more `Collection`s to a given `Page`.
It can be configured at the Page or `Site` levels and can be configured to provide the latest entries
for any number of `Collection`s. The entries used are in the sort order as defined in the `Collection`
object.

### Settings

The plugin has the following default settings:

```python
{
    "collection": ["url"],
    "entries": ["title", "url"],
    "pages": ["index"],
    "max_entries": 3,
}
```

- `collection` - a list of attributes to include for the collection.
- `entries` - a list of attributes to include for a given entry.
- `pages` - a list of pages to add the `COLLECTIONS` entry to it's `template_vars` (Only needed when running as a
`Site` plugin)
- `max_entries` - The maximum number of entries to include for a collection. The default is 3. `-1` indicates
that all entries should be populated.

In addition to the default settings entries can be added for each `Collection` defining how many
entries it should include:

- Positive integer - Include up to the number specified entries. For example: `'Collection1': 5`
will include the 5 latest entries in the `template_vars`.
- `0` - Exclude this collection. For example: `'Collection2': 0` will not include `Collection2`
in the `template_vars`.
- Negative integer - Include all entries. For example: `'Collection3': -1` will include all
entries for `Collection3` in the `template_vars`

### `Page` level configuration

To configure at the `Page` level just include `(LatestEntris, <settings_dict)` in the `plugins`
attribute when declaring the `Page`. If no settings overrides are needed, include `LatestEntries`
by itself in the `plugin` attribute.

Example:

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page
from re-plugin-pack import LatestEntries

app = Site()
@app.page
class MyPage(Page):
    plugins = [
        (
            LatestEntries,
            {
                "Collection1": 5,  # Include the 5 most recent entries
                "Collection2": 0,  # Exclude this collection
                "Collection3": -1,  # Include all entries in the collection
            },
        )
    ]
    ...
```

### `Site` level configuration

To configure at the `Site` level call `app.register_plugins(LatestEntries, LatestEntries=<settings>)`
if settings overrides are being used. To configure without additional settings, call
`app.register_plugin(LatestEntries)`.

Example:

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page
from re-plugin-pack import LatestEntries

app = Site()

# The following will use the default settings overriding the pages to run on to be page1 and page2
app.register_plugins(LatestEntries, LatestEntries={'pages': ['page1', 'page2']})

# The following will only enable for the Blog collection:
app.register_plugins(LatestEntries, LatestEntries={'max_entries': 0, 'Blog': 3})
```

NOTE: If configuring at the `Site` level the registration should be done _after_ adding all
`Page` entries to the `Site`. When adding a `Page` to a `Site` all plugins registered to the
`Site` are automatically registered to the new `Page` object.

### Including in the `Page` template

The latest entries will be added to the `COLLECTIONS` key of the `template_vars` for the `Page`
and can be accessed in the template as `COLLECTIONS`.

Example template implementation:

```
{% for collection, collection_data in COLLECTIONS.items() %}
    Most recent <a href="{{ collection_data['url'] }}">{{ collection }}</a> entries:
    <ul>
    {% for entry in collection_data['entries'] %}
        <li><a href="{{ entry['url'] }}">{{ entry['title'] }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endfor %}
```

## `NextPrevPlugin`

This plugin will give each page in a `Collection` access to certain attributes of the next and
previous pages in the collection. By default, only the URL and title of those pages will be
made available, however additional attributes may also be requested via the settings. If an
attributes is in the list to include but does not exist in the page(s) `None` will be used.
This plugin runs at the `Collection` level and can be registered at the `Site` or `Collection`
level.

### Settings

This plugin has no default settings. If you wish to add additional attributes, include in the
registration a settings dictionary with a key of `additional_attributes` having a list of
attributes as its value.

### `Site` level configuration

To configure at the `Site` level call `app.register_plugins(NextPrevPlugin, NextPrevPlugin=<settings>)`
if settings overrides are being used. To configure without additional settings, call
`app.register_plugin(NextPrevPlugin)`.

Example:

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page
from re-plugin-pack import NextPrevPlugin

app = Site()

# The following will include the date attribute in in the data made available.
app.register_plugins(NextPrevPlugin, NextPrevPlugin={'additional_attributes': ['date']})

# The following will not include any additional attributes
app.register_plugins(NextPrevPlugin)
```

NOTE: If configuring at the `Site` level the registration should be done _after_ adding all
`Collection` entries to the `Site`. When adding a `Collection` to a `Site` all plugins
registered to the `Site` are automatically registered to the new `Collection` object.

### `Collection` level configuration

To configure at the `Page` level just include `(NextPrevPlugin, <settings_dict)` in the `plugins`
attribute when declaring the `Collection`. If no settings overrides are needed, include
`NextPrevPlugin` by itself in the `plugin` attribute.

Example:

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page
from re-plugin-pack import NextPrevPlugin

app = Site()
@app.page
class MyPage(Page):
    plugins = [
        (
            NextPrevPlugin,
            {
                'additional_attributes': [  # This will make the date and description attributes available
                    'date',
                    'description',
                ]
            },
        )
    ]
    ...
```

### Including in the `Collection` template

When run this plugin will add a dictionary with the requested data to the `template_vars` of
each page in the `Collection`. The dictionary added looks like:

```python
{
    'collection_url': <url>,
    'collection_title': <title>,
    'next_url': <url>,
    'next_title': <title>,
    'prev_url': <url>,
    'prev_title': <title>,
}
```

If `additional_attributes` are included in the settings, they will be in the dictionary as:
`prev_<attr>: <value>` and `next_<attr>: <value>`.

```
{% if prev_url %}
<span class="prev_data">
Previous: <a href="{{ prev_url }}">{{ prev_title }}</a>
</span>
{% endif %}
{% if next_url %}
<span class="next_data">
Next: <a href="{{ next_url }}">{{ next_title }}</a>
</span>
{% endif %}
```

## `Drafts`

This is a plugin that will skip pages in a `Collection` that are marked as `draft`.  This allows
you to have WIP posts and still make changes to other things without publishing things that are
not ready to be posted.

### Settings

The `Drafts` plugin has a single setting:

```python
{
    'show_drafts': True,
}
```

When `show_drafts` is set to `False` the plugin will run, prior to rendering the `Collection`
and remove all pages in the collection that have a `True` value for the `draft` attribute will
not be rendered when building the site. This plugin runs at the `Collection` level and can be
registered either `Site`-wide or for individual collections.

**NOTE**: Plugins run in the reverse order of registration. If you are using both this and
[`NextPrevPlugin`](NextPrevPlugin) make sure that you register `NextPrevPlugin` (or any similar
plugin) _before_ you register `Drafts` or you might have unexpected results as pages that were
processed will have been removed.

### Making sure that drafts show locally but not on your production site

In order to have this work effectively, so that you can see the draft posts locally when you
use `render-engine serve`, you will need to differentiate between the environments. To
accomplish this you can use an environment variable and add this line of code into your
`app.py`:

```python
import os

ENABLE_DRAFTS = {"show_drafts": os.environ.get("SHOW_DRAFTS", False)}
```

When you register the plugin make sure to include the `ENABLE_DRAFTS` as the settings
for the plugin:

```python
import os
from re_plugin_pack import Drafts
from render_engine import Site, Collection

ENABLE_DRAFTS = {"show_drafts": os.environ.get("SHOW_DRAFTS", False)}app=Site()

# Either at the `Site` level:
app.register_plugins(Drafts, Drafts=ENABLE_DRAFTS)

# Or at the `Collection` level:
@app.collection
class MyCollection(Collection):
    plugins=[(Drafts, ENABLE_DRAFTS)]
    ...
```

### Using `Drafts` with `NextPrevPlugin` (or other, similar, `Collection` level plugins)

Make sure that you register plugins in the order that you want them to run. Remember that
any plugin that is registered with the `Site` prior to creating the `Collection` is included
in the `Collection` the will have been registered first and will run _after_ plugins that
are registered at the `Collection` level. Since plugins are invoked in the _reverse_ order
of registration `Drafts` should be the last plugin run for a `Collection`.

Example registration:

```python
import os
from re_plugin_pack import Drafts, NextPrevPlugin
from render_engine import Site, Collection

ENABLE_DRAFTS = {"show_drafts": os.environ.get("SHOW_DRAFTS", False)}app=Site()

@app.collection
class MyCollection(Collection):
    plugins = [
        NextPrevPlugin,
        (Drafts, ENABLE_DRAFTS),
    ]
```

The above order will run the `Drafts` plugin first on that collection.

### Marking a post as a `draft`

To mark a post as a `draft` just add a truthy value for the `draft` attribute to the content:

```
---
title: WIP Post
date: 2025-06-01T02:49:18
draft: Yes
---
This is a draft post
```

## `DateNormalizer`

The goal of this plugin is to normalize entries in the `date` attribute of pages. This is necessary
since valid entries include `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, and date like strings. Since
inconsistencies in the values of these fields can cause issues with sorting:

```
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'datetime.datetime' and 'datetime.date'
```

and rendering if using the `format_datetime` function it is important that the date-like objects
be normalized into `datetime.datetime` objects regardless of how they are set.

### DateNormalizer Settings

`DateNormalizer` has no settings.

### Configuration

`DateNormalizer` is a `Site` level plugins that runs prior to the site being rendered. It must
be registered at the site level:

```python
from render_engine import Site, Page
from re-plugin-pack import DateNormalizer

app = Site()
app.register_plugins(DateNormalizer)
```
