# Alitra

WIP Library for ALIgnment and TRAnsformation between fixed coordinate frames. The transform
is described by a translation and a homogeneous rotation.

Developed for transforming between the fixed local coordinate-frame and the asset-fixed
coordinate-frame.

## Installation

### Installation from pip

```
pip install alitra
```

```python
import alitra
help(alitra)
```

### Installation from source

```
git clone https://github.com/equinor/alitra

```

You can test whether installation was successfull with pytest

```
pytest .
```

### Local development

```
