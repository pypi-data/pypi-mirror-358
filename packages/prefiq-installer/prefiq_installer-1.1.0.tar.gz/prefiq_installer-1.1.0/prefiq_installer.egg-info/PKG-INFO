### 1. Install Prefiq

```bash
pip install prefiq
````

Or use the installer script:

```bash
python install_prefiq.py
```

### 2. Create a New Project

```bash
prefiq install sundar
```

This sets up the `sundar/` project folder with:

* ✅ Python virtual environment (`venv/`)
* ✅ Standard files: `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`
* ✅ Base framework folder: `prefentity/`

---

## 📁 Create Apps Using Templates

Inside your project folder:

```bash
cd sundar
```

### ▶️ Full App Scaffold

```bash
prefiq new-app crm
```

Creates a full app at `apps/crm/` with:

```
apps/
└── crm/
    ├── app.py
    ├── config.py
    ├── assets/
    ├── templates/
    ├── routes/
    ├── logic/
    ├── database/
    └── ...
```

### ⚡ Base (Minimal) App Scaffold

```bash
prefiq new-app auth --base
```

Generates only the essential app folders and files.

### ♻️ Force Overwrite an Existing App

```bash
prefiq new-app blog --force
```

This will overwrite the existing `apps/blog` folder.

---

## 🧩 Manage Apps

### List Registered Apps

```bash
prefiq list-apps
```

### Remove an App

```bash
prefiq remove-app blog
```

This will remove the folder and update `prefentity/manifest.json`.
