-----------

Pytest configuration and fixtures local to rsm/.  The definitions here are only visible
to tests within this directory and its children dirs.  In particular, for pytest to run
unit tests (or other tests) in the tests directory (../tests/), there needs to be a
different conftest.py file in that directory.
