# MIXSQPX:  A Jax-compatible interface to the mixSQP algorithm

This package provides a `jax`-compatible interface to the mixSQP algorithm described in,

> Kim, Y., Carbonetto, P., Stephens, M., & Anitescu, M. (2020). A Fast Algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Mixture Proportions Using Sequential Quadratic Programming. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 29(2), 261â€“273. 

The implementation of the mixSQP algorithm in this package was ported from the [R
implementation](https://github.com/stephenslab/mixSQP) by
the authors of this paper which uses the Rarmadillo package as an interface to the
Armadillo C++ library.

This package (`misxqpx`) provides a function `mixsolve`, which can can be transformed with [Jax](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) transformations such as `jit`.

## Installation

We use the [Pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) package manager to
handle installation and dependencies.

### Linux Installation

``` bash
# Install pixi if you don't have it already
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pdiegert/mixsqpx.git
cd mixsqpx

# Install dependencies and build the package
pixi install
```

### Windows Installation

``` powershell
# Install pixi if you don't have it already
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pdiegert/mixsqpx.git
cd mixsqpx

# Install dependencies and build the package
pixi install
```

### Verification

Run the test suite to verify your installation:

``` bash
pixi run test
```
