    The block device lvm lvs `size` attribute was passed directly to lvcreate,
    so using units M, G means base 2. All other block device size values are
    parsed with accepted conventions of M, B being base 10 and MiB, GiB being
    base 2. lvm lvs `size` attributes are now parsed the same as other size
    attributes. This improves consistency and makes it practical to calculate
    volume sizes to fill the partition size. This means existing size values
    will now create slightly smaller volumes. Previous sizes can be restored by
    changing the unit to MiB, GiB, or increasing the value for a base 10 unit.

    Requested sizes will also be rounded down to align with physical extents
    (4MiB).
