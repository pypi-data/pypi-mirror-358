features:
  - Supports Gentoo profile 23.0 and removes support for the nonworking
    17.1 and 17.0 profiles.
  - Gentoo element updated to avoid using testing (~arch) packages.
  - Gentoo element now uses upstream binary package host by default.
fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where the growroot element on openrc init systems would
    not function.
  - Fixed an issue where the devuser element was unable to grant sudo
    capabilities on gentoo images.
  - Fixed an issue in Gentoo implmentation for install-packages element
    where build time would grow linearly with each additional package removal.
    Now, all removed packages are deselected and removed in a single
    transaction.
