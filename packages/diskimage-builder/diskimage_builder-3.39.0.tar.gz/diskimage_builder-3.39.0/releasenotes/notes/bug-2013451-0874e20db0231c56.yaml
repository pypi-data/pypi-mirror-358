fixes:
  - |
    The ``Satellite Client`` reposotories replaces the ``Satellite Tools``
    repository since Satellite 6.11. The default repo labels in the
    ``rhel-common`` element has been updated to reflect this change.
    See `Red Hat Satellite 6.11 Release Notes <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.11/html/release_notes/assembly_introducing-red-hat-satellite_sat6-release-notes>`_.

    To enable users that need to use the legacy ``Satellite Tools``
    repository, the ``REG_SAT_REPO`` environment variable has been added to
    enable manual override of the Satellite repository.
