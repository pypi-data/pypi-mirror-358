deprecations:
  - |
    The ``deploy-baremetal``, ``deploy-kexec``, ``deploy-tgtadm``,
    and ``deploy-targetcli`` elements are deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release of diskimage-builder. The origins of the elemenets largely
    dates back to the early efforts to support baremetal deployment, and the
    methods have been long ago moved away from.
