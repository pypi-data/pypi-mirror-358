features:
  - |
    Adds a ``fips`` element which attempts to enable FIPS mode configuration
    into the disk image being created.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes a possible case with a FIPS enabled disk image where the
    cryptographic policies may be applied for enforcement of FIPS mode,
    but the underlying kernel command line may be missing. This in particular
    was discovered when testing on Rocky Linux. We now test, and add the FIPS
    kernel command line flag if it is otherwise enabled.
