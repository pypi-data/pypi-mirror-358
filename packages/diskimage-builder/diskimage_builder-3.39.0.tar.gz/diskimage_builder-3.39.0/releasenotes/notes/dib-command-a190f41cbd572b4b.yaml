    A new command ``diskimage-builder`` is now provided (also aliased to
    ``dib``). It provides a YAML file based interface to ``disk-image-create``
    and ``ramdisk-image-create``. All arguments can be specified as yaml
    dictionary entries, along with environment variable overrides which are
    applied over the provided environment.
