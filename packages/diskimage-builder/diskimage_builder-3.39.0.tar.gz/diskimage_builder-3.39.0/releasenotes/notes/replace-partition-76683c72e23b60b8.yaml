    The new element ``replace-partition`` has been added which allows a
    diskimage-builder built image to be used as the base image so that it can be
    copied to a new partition layout. This allows the content to be copied from
    one image to a new one without making any package changes. The element
    ``replace-partition-redhat`` has a documented example for redhat family
    images.
