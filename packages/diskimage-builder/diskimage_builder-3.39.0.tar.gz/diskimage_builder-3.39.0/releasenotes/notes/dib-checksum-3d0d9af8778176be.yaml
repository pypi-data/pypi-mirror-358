    The usage of the ``DIB_CHECKSUM`` variable is extended. Now to be more
    specific the variable can be set to the ``sha256`` or ``md5`` value to
    generate only one checksum file. There also can be provided a
    comma-separated list of the values, but only ``sha256`` and ``md5``
    supported. For backward compatibility using ``DIB_CHECKSUM=1`` or option
    ``--checksum`` in the command line still can be used to generate all
    supported checksums.
