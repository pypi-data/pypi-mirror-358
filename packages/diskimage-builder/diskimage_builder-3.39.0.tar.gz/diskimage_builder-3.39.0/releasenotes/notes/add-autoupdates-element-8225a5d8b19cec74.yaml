features:
  - |
    A new element ``autoupdates`` is added to DIB. This element, with proper
    configuration, will enable and configure cloud images to have a system that
    automatically updates the image, from the upstream binaries. To this end,
    ``DIB_DEB_UPDATES_CONF`` or ``DIB_YUM_UPDATES_CONF`` must be set during build time.
other:
  - |
    The ``autoupdates`` element has only been tested in Rocky and Ubuntu images.
    In addition, the element does not check the validity of the configuration files in any way.
