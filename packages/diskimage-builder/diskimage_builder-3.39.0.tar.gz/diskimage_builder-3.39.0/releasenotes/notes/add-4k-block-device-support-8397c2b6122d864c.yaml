    Adds the ability for diskimage-builder to create images with different
    block sizes. By default, this remains at the default of 512 bytes,
    but some newer devices require 4096 bytes to be used, which impacts
    the overall layout rendering 512 byte images incompatible. This setting
    can also be asserted and overridden using the ``DIB_BLOCK_SIZE``
    environment variable, but alternatively exists as a new ``block_size``
    parameter for ``local_loop`` section in block device YAML documents.
