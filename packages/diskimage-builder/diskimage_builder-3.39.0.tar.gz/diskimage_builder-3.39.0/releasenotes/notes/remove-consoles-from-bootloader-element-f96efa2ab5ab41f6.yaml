    Adds logic to permit the removal of consoles when the bootloader element
    when no configuration has been expressed which requests it, and serial
    console is disabled. This involves ``DIB_BOOTLOADER_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL``
    being set to an empty string and ``DIB_BOOTLOADER_USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE``
    is set to ``False``.
