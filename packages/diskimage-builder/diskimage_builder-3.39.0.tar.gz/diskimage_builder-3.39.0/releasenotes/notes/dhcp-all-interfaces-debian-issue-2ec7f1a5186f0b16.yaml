    The dhcp-all-interfaces element attempts to work with "predictable
    interface names". During boot the name of the interfaces is changed from
    ethX to the new scheme, for example enpXsX; depending on the Linux kernel
    this move may be captured by udev as an "add" or "move" event. The
    dhcp-all-interfaces udev rule has been updated to match against both
    possible events. If you prefer to not use predictable names your image
    builds can set DIB_BOOTLOADER_DEFAULT_CMDLINE with net.ifnames=0 or mask
    the default policy with `ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/network/99-default.link`.
    This process is documented by systemd:
    https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/

    Note that this update reverts previous changes to disable predictable
    interface names completely when using dhcp-all-interfaces. Predictable
    device names were disabled in an effort to make dhcp-all-interfaces
    function on Debian Bullseye, but this broke any users that wished to
    use predictable device names. Instaed we make predictable device names
    work on Debian Bullseye and allow users to disable predictable device
    names should they choose to.
