When the module is installed, by default the options to hide empty categories are active.

These options can be configured in the web editor. To do this, go to ‘/shop’ and activate
or deactivate the options to hide empty categories from the web editor in the ‘Customize’ tab.

There are two options:

- Hide Empty Category Filmstrip: to hide/show empty categories in the top category bar.
- Hide Empty Category list: to hide/show empty categories in the left category list.
