## MQTT MCP Server

A lightweight [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects LLM agents to [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) devices in a secure, standardized way, enabling seamless integration of AI-driven workflows with Building Automation (BAS), Industrial Control (ICS) and Smart Home systems, allowing agents to monitor real-time sensor data, actuate devices, and orchestrate complex automation tasks.

## Getting Started

The server is built with [FastMCP 2.0](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome) and uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for project and dependency management. Simply run the following command to install `uv` or check out the [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more details and alternative installation methods.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Clone the repository, then use `uv` to install project dependencies and create a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp.git
cd mqtt-mcp
uv sync
```

Start the MQTT MCP server by running the following command in your terminal. It defaults to using the `Streamable HTTP` transport on portâ€¯`8000`.

```bash
uv run mqtt-mcp
```

To confirm the server is up and running and explore available resources and tools, run the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and connect it to the MQTT MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/`. Make sure to set the transport to `Streamable HTTP`.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

## Core Concepts

The MQTT MCP server leverages FastMCP 2.0's core building blocks - resource templates, tools, and prompts - to streamline MQTT receive and publish operations with minimal boilerplate and a clean, Pythonic interface.

### Receive Message

Each topic on a device is mapped to a resource (and exposed as a tool) and [resource templates](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources#resource-templates) are used to specify connection details (host, port) and receive parameters (topic, timeout).

```python
@mcp.resource("mqtt://{host}:{port}/{topic*}")
@mcp.tool(
    annotations={
        "title": "Receive Message",
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "openWorldHint": True,
    }
)
async def receive_message(
    topic: str,
    host: str = settings.mqtt.host,
    port: int = settings.mqtt.port,
    timeout: int = 60,
) -> str:
    """Receives a message published to the specified topic, if any."""
    ...
```

### Publish Message

Publish operations are exposed as a [tool](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), accepting the same connection details (host, port) and allowing to publish a message to a specific topic in a single, atomic call.

```python
@mcp.tool(
    annotations={
        "title": "Publish Message",
        "readOnlyHint": False,
        "openWorldHint": True,
    }
)
async def publish_message(
    topic: str,
    message: str,
    host: str = settings.mqtt.host,
    port: int = settings.mqtt.port,
) -> str:
    """Publishes a message to the specified topic."""
    ...
```

### Authentication

To enable Bearer Token authentication for the `Streamable HTTP` transport, provide the RSA public key in PEM format in the `.env` file. Check out the [Bearer Token Authentication](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/bearer) section for more details.

### Interactive Prompts

Structured response messages are implemented using [prompts](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts) that help guide the interaction, clarify missing parameters, and handle errors gracefully.

```python
@mcp.prompt(name="mqtt_help", tags={"mqtt", "help"})
def mqtt_help() -> list[Message]:
    """Provides examples of how to use the MQTT MCP server."""
    ...
```

Here are some example text inputs that can be used to interact with the server.

```text
Publish {"foo":"bar"} to topic "devices/foo" on 127.0.0.1:1883.
Receive a message from topic "devices/bar", waiting up to 30 seconds.
```

## Examples

The `examples` folder contains sample projects showing how to integrate with the MQTT MCP server using various client APIs to provide tools and context to LLMs.

- [openai-agents](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp/tree/main/examples/openai-agents) - shows how to connect to the MQTT MCP server using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/).
- [openai](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp/tree/main/examples/openai) - a minimal app leveraging remote MCP server support in the [OpenAI Python library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp).
- [pydantic-ai](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp/tree/main/examples/pydantic-ai) - shows how to connect to the MQTT MCP server using the [PydanticAI Agent Framework](https://ai.pydantic.dev).

## Docker

The MQTT MCP server can be deployed as a Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run -dit \
  --name mqtt-mcp \
  --restart=always \
  -p 8080:8000 \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp:latest
```

This maps port `8080` on the host to the MCP server's port `8000` inside the container and loads settings from the `.env` file, if present.
