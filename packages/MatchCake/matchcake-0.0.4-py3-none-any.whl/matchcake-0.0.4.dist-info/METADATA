              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Description

MatchCake is a Python package that provides a new PennyLane device for simulating a specific class of quantum 
circuits called Matchgate circuits or matchcircuits. These circuits are made with matchgates, a class of restricted 
quantum unitaries that are parity-preserving and operate on nearest-neighbor qubits. These constraints lead to 
matchgates being classically simulable in polynomial time.

Additionally, this package provides quantum kernels made with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) API allowing the 
use matchcircuits as kernels in quantum machine learning algorithms. One way to use these kernels could be in a Support Vector 
Machine (SVM). In the [benchmark/classification](benchmark/classification/README.md) folder, you can 
find some scripts that use SVM with matchcircuits as a kernel to classify the Iris dataset, the Breast Cancer dataset, 
and the Digits dataset in polynomial time with high accuracy.

# Quick Usage Preview

## Quantum Circuit Simulation with MatchCake
```python
import matchcake as mc
import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np
from pennylane.ops.qubit.observables import BasisStateProjector

# Create a Non-Interacting Fermionic Device
nif_device = mc.NonInteractingFermionicDevice(wires=4)
initial_state = np.zeros(len(nif_device.wires), dtype=int)

# Define a quantum circuit
def circuit(params, wires, initial_state=None):
    qml.BasisState(initial_state, wires=wires)
    for i, even_wire in enumerate(wires[:-1:2]):
        idx = list(wires).index(even_wire)
        curr_wires = [wires[idx], wires[idx + 1]]
        mc.operations.fRXX(params, wires=curr_wires)
        mc.operations.fRYY(params, wires=curr_wires)
        mc.operations.fRZZ(params, wires=curr_wires)
    for i, odd_wire in enumerate(wires[1:-1:2]):
        idx = list(wires).index(odd_wire)
        mc.operations.fSWAP(wires=[wires[idx], wires[idx + 1]])
    projector: BasisStateProjector = qml.Projector(initial_state, wires=wires)
    return qml.expval(projector)

# Create a QNode
nif_qnode = qml.QNode(circuit, nif_device)
qml.draw_mpl(nif_qnode)(np.array([0.1, 0.2]), wires=nif_device.wires, initial_state=initial_state)

# Evaluate the QNode
expval = nif_qnode(np.random.random(2), wires=nif_device.wires, initial_state=initial_state)
print(f"Expectation value: {expval}")
```

## Data Classification with MatchCake

```python
from matchcake.ml.kernels import FermionicPQCKernel
from matchcake.ml.svm import FixedSizeSVC
from matchcake.ml.visualisation import ClassificationVisualizer
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Load the iris dataset
X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)).fit_transform(X)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create and fit the model
model = FixedSizeSVC(kernel_cls=FermionicPQCKernel, kernel_kwargs=dict(size=4), random_state=0)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
test_accuracy = model.score(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Visualize the classification
viz = ClassificationVisualizer(x=X, n_pts=1_000)
viz.plot_2d_decision_boundaries(model=model, y=y, show=True)
