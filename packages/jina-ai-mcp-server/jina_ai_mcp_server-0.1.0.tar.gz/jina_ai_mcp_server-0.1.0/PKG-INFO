# Jina AI MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes the functionalities of the Jina AI API as a set of tools.

## Features

*   **Embeddings API**: Convert text/images to fixed-length vectors.
*   **Reranker API**: Find the most relevant search results.
*   **Reader API**: Retrieve and parse content from a URL in an LLM-friendly format.
*   **Search API**: Search the web for information and return results optimized for LLMs.
*   **DeepSearch API**: Combines web searching, reading, and reasoning for comprehensive investigation.
*   **Segmenter API**: Tokenizes text and divides text into manageable chunks.
*   **Classifier API (Text)**: Perform zero-shot classification for text content.
*   **Classifier API (Image)**: Perform zero-shot classification for image content.

## Installation

This MCP server can be installed and run using `uvx` once it's published to PyPI.
