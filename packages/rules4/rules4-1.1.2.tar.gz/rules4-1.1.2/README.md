# rules4

A universal CLI utility to configure AI rules files (e.g., .roo/rules, CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules) for any project, based on the latest industry best practices via live Perplexity research.

## Features

- Supports any language or framework via `--lang` and `--tags` options
- Configures rules for tools like Cursor, Roo, Claude, and more
- Flexible model selection: Use OpenAI or Anthropic models for both generation and review
- Mix and match models: e.g., Claude for generation, GPT-4 for review
- Uses live Perplexity API for up-to-date best practices
- Built-in `--list-models` command to see all available models
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Prompts before overwriting existing files
- Simple one-command install (packaged for PyPI)
- Designed for future MCP integration

## Installation

```bash
pip install rules4
```

## Quick Start

1. Initialize rules4 in your project:

```bash
rules4 init
```

2. Generate rules for your favorite AI coding assistant:

```bash
# For Cursor
rules4 cursor --lang python --tags "testing,security"

# For Claude with research
rules4 claude --research --lang javascript --tags "react,typescript"

# For all configured tools
rules4 generate
```

## API Keys and Environment Variables

`rules4` interacts with various AI models and research services. To use these features, you need to set up the corresponding API keys as environment variables:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Required for generating rules using OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o`).
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Required for generating rules using Anthropic models (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`).
- **PERPLEXITY_API_KEY**: Required if you use the `--research` flag to perform research with Perplexity AI.

Example (add to your shell profile, e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_perplexity_api_key"
```

## Usage

### Basic Rule Generation

To generate rules for a specific tool (e.g., `copilot`) for a given language and tags:

```bash
rules4 copilot --lang python --tags "pytest,langgraph"
```

This command will:

- Use `gpt-4-turbo` as the primary model (default).
- Generate rules for Python projects, focusing on `pytest` and `langgraph`.
- Save the rules to `.github/copilot-python-pytest,langgraph.md` (or similar, depending on the tool).

### Advanced Usage

You can specify a primary model, a review model, and enable research. Both `--primary` and `--review` flags support OpenAI and Anthropic models:

```bash
# Use Claude as primary, GPT-4 as reviewer
rules4 copilot --primary claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 --review gpt-4o --research --lang javascript --tags "react,typescript"

# Use GPT-4 for both generation and review
rules4 cursor --primary gpt-4-turbo --review gpt-4o --lang python --tags "async,testing"

# Use Claude for both generation and review
rules4 claude --primary claude-3-opus-20240229 --review claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 --lang go --tags "concurrency"
```

These commands demonstrate the flexibility:
- You can use any combination of OpenAI and Anthropic models
- The same model can be used for both primary generation and review
- Research always uses Perplexity's `sonar-pro` model

### Generating Rules for All Configured Tools

If you have a `.rules4rc` file configured, you can generate rules for all specified tools:

```bash
rules4 generate --lang go --tags "code style"
```

This command will:

- Read the list of tools from your `.rules4rc` file.
- Generate rules for each tool, focusing on `code style` for Go projects.

### Command-Line Options

- `--primary <model_name>`: Specify the primary AI model for rule generation. Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic models (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`).
- `--review <model_name>`: Specify an AI model for reviewing and refining the generated rules. Also supports both OpenAI and Anthropic models.
- `--research`: Enable research using Perplexity AI before rule generation.
- `--lang <language>`: Specify the programming language for rule generation (e.g., `python`, `javascript`, `go`).
- `--tags <tag1,tag2,...>`: Comma-separated list of tags or topics for rule generation (e.g., `pytest,langgraph`, `react,typescript`, `code style`).
- `--dry-run`: Preview the changes without actually writing any files.
- `--yes`, `-y`: Overwrite existing files without prompting for confirmation.
- `--project-path <path>`: (Optional) Specify the target project directory. Defaults to the current directory.

### Listing Available Models

To see all available models for use with `--primary` and `--review`:

```bash
rules4 list-models
```

This will display models grouped by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity).
