**ΣPI** is a lightweight, universal SDK to calculate Predictive Integrity (PI), a metric from the Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT) of consciousness. It provides a powerful, real-time proxy for your model's "cognitive state" during training.

Stop just looking at `loss`. Start observing how your model _learns_.

## What is Predictive Integrity (PI)?

PI is a score (0 to 1) reflecting a model's internal world model integrity, derived from prediction error (Epsilon), model uncertainty (Tau), and global gradient norm (Surprise). High PI indicates healthy learning; a drop can signal issues like overfitting before loss metrics do.

### Why Use ΣPI?

- **Early Warning for Training Instability:** Detects subtle shifts in model "cognition" before loss metrics diverge.
- **Insight into OOD Impact:** Quantifies the "surprise" your model experiences when encountering out-of-distribution data.
- **Understanding Model Overfitting:** Reveals when your model's internal world becomes too rigid or too chaotic.
- **Quantifying Cognitive Load:** Provides a novel metric for the "effort" your model expends to integrate new information.

## Model Zoo & Experiments

The complete model zoo, experimental framework (PILR-S), and all associated results have been migrated to a dedicated repository: **[dmf-archive/PILF](https://github.com/dmf-archive/PILF)**.

This `SigmaPI` repository now contains only the core SDK for calculating Predictive Integrity. Please visit the `PILF` repository for all implementation examples, training scripts, and pre-trained models.

## Installation

`SigmaPI` requires `torch` to be installed. To avoid conflicts with your existing (e.g., GPU-specific) `torch` installation, it is not listed as a hard dependency.

Please ensure `torch` is installed in your environment. If you want to install it alongside this package, you can use the `[torch]` extra:

```bash
# If you already have torch installed
pip install sigma-pi

# To install with torch
pip install sigma-pi[torch]
```

## How to Use

The `sigma-pi` package provides the core `SigmaPI` monitor. Here is a basic integration example:

```python
import torch
from sigma_pi import SigmaPI

# 1. Initialize the SigmaPI monitor once outside your training loop
sigma_pi = SigmaPI(device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# 2. Inside your training/validation loop:
#    (Ensure you are in a `with torch.enable_grad():` block for validation)

# Calculate loss
loss_epsilon = loss_fn(logits, target)

# Compute gradients (this is crucial)
model.zero_grad()
loss_epsilon.backward(create_graph=True) # Use create_graph=True if you need to backprop through PI metrics

# Calculate PI metrics
pi_metrics = sigma_pi.calculate(
    model=model,
    loss_epsilon=loss_epsilon,
    logits=logits
)

print(f"PI: {pi_metrics['pi_score']:.4f}, Surprise: {pi_metrics['surprise']:.4f}")

# Don't forget to step your optimizer after calculating PI
optimizer.step()
```

The returned `pi_metrics` dictionary contains:

- `pi_score`: The overall predictive integrity (0-1)
- `surprise`: Gradient norm indicating model adaptation
- `normalized_error`: Error scaled by model uncertainty
- `cognitive_cost`: Combined cost of error and surprise
- Additional component metrics for detailed analysis
