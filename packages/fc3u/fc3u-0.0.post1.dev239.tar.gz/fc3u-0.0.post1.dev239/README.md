# FC3U

Stands for Fractional Cover 3 Universal. This has been forked from [fractionalcover3](https://gitlab.com/jrsrp/themes/cover/fractionalcover3/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) package to add support to apple's silicon macs.

Vegetation fractional cover package.


## Description

Vegetation fractional cover represents the exposed proportion of green, non-green, and bare cover within each pixel.
Landsat-scale ground cover information is important for soil erosion and nutrient flux estimates into the stream
network, as well as assessing the impact of human activities.

The fractional cover v3.0 model is a Multi Layer Perceptron (neural network) model architecture that uses surface 
reflectance to estimate the three cover fractions of bare ground, photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic 
vegetation (NPV). The MLP model was trained with Tensorflow using Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI surface reflectance and 
a collection of 4000 field observations of overstorey and ground cover. The field observations covered a wide 
variety of vegetation, soil and climate types across Australia, collected between 1997 and 2018 following the 
procedure outlined in:

## Installation:

```
python>=3.8
numpy
tflite; on non apple silicon machines
tensorflow; on apple silicon
```

install numpy, followed by gdal


The package comes with two scripts to produce fractional cover images on RSC standard
landsat surface reflectance and Sentinel2 Surface Reflectance. To use these scripts, you
will require some additional dependencies, which you can install if you have access
to them using the `rsc` option. For example:

```
# install numpy, then gdal first
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install gdal==$(gdal-config --version)
python -m pip install fractionalcover3[rsc]  --pre rsc
```

Not all of the dependencies are on PyPI, so you may need to manually install 
these from source first. The Raster Processing package `rios`, is
available from github (check their
[documentation](http://www.rioshome.org/en/latest/) ), but the `rsc` package
is internal to the [JRSRP](https://www.jrsrp.org.au/). Contact the authors for
more information on access.

While the scripts won't function without these packages, they are included in
case they are useful templates for writing similar scripts to operate on
complete images.


## Basic Usage

The main function in the package is `unmix_fractional_cover`, which takes
a numpy 3d array for surface reflectance (scaled between 0 and 1), and
produces a 3d array of fractional cover. The output has 3 bands, one for
each bare, green and non-green components.

The unmixing uses a tensorflow model. This is supplied as a
`tflite.Interpreter` object. There are four models provided with the package,
each at varying levels of complexity. These can be selected by number, with 1
the simplest and 4 the most complex.

The simplest example might look like:

```python
from fractionalcover3.unmixcover import unmix_fractional_cover
from fractionalcover3 import data
import numpy as np
inref = np.array([562, 825, 1088, 2056, 2951, 2187]) * 0.0001
inref.shape = (6, 1, 1)

# use the default model provided
fractions = unmix_fractional_cover(inref,
                                       fc_model=data.get_model()
                                  )
for i,fraction in enumerate(['bare','green','dry']):
  print(fraction, fractions[i,0,0])
print('total', fractions.sum())
```

Output should be:

```python
bare 0.12142971
green 0.23126282
dry 0.6459608
total 0.99865335
```
