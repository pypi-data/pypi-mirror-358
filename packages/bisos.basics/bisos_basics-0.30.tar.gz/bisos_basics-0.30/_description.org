* Part of BISOS --- ByStar Internet Services Operating System

Layered on top of Debian, *BISOS*: (By* Internet Services Operating System) is a
unified and universal framework for developing both internet services and
software-service continuums that use internet services. See [[https://github.com/bxGenesis/start][Bootstrapping
ByStar, BISOS and Blee]] for information about getting started with BISOS.\\
*BISOS* is a foundation for *The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem* which is
described as a cure for losses of autonomy and privacy in a book titled: [[https://github.com/bxplpc/120033][Nature
of Polyexistentials]]

/bisos.basics/ is part of BISOS.

* bisos.basics is a Command Services (PyCS) Facility

bisos.basics can be used locally on command-line or remotely as a service.
bisos.basics is a PyCS multi-unit command-service.
PyCS is a framework that converges developement of CLI and Services.
PyCS is an alternative to FastAPI, Typer and Click.

bisos.basics uses the PyCS Framework to:

1) Provide access to basics facilities through native python.
2) Provide local access to basics facilities on CLI.
3) Provide remote access to basics facilities through remote invocation of
   python Expection Complete Operations using [[https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/rpyc][rpyc]].
4) Provide remote access to basics facilities on CLI.

What is unique in the PyCS-Framework is that these four models are all
a single abstraction.

The core of PyCS-Framework is the /bisos.b/ package (the PyCS-Foundation).
See https://github.com/bisos-pip/b for an overview.
