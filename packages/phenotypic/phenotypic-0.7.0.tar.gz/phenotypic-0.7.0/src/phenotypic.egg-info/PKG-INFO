# PhenoTypic: A Python Framework for Bio-Image Analysis
![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pre--Alpha-red)

A modular image processing framework developed at the NSF Ex-FAB BioFoundry.

---

*Documentation* [here](https://wheeldon-lab.github.io/PhenoTypic/)

## Overview
PhenoTypic provides a modular toolkit designed to simplify and accelerate the development of bio-image analysis pipelines. 
Its structured architecture allows researchers and developers to seamlessly integrate custom computer vision modules, avoiding 
the need to build entirely new packages from scratch. Additionally, PhenoTypic supports incorporating components from 
other existing image analysis tools into a cohesive, unified ecosystem.


## Installation

### Pip
```
pip install phenotypic
```
Note: may not always be the most up-to-date version

### Manual Installation
```  
git clone https://github.com/Wheeldon-Lab/PhenoTypic.git
cd PhenoTypic
pip install -e .

cd PhenoTypic
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```  

## Acknowledgements

### CellProfiler
PhenoTypic has drawn inspiration and foundational concepts from [CellProfiler](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler), 
an open-source software platform for bio-image analysis developed by the Broad Institute Imaging Platform. CellProfiler's modularity, 
pipeline-oriented design, and extensive documentation have significantly influenced the development approach and structure of PhenoTypic.
