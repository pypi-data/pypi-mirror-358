        ## How to use RNAdvisor 2
        
        RNAdvisor 2 is an updated version of the [RNAdvisor](https://github.com/EvryRNA/rnadvisor) tool with an interface available.
        The tool is designed to compute the quality of RNA 3D structures. It computes a variety of metrics and scoring functions.
        
        There are two main modes available: the **metric** mode and the **scoring function** mode:
        
        - The **metric** mode computes a variety of metrics for the input structures compared to a true reference structure.
        - The **scoring function** mode computes the RNA structural quality without the need for a reference structure.
        
        ### Inputs
        
        The user can choose to select one reference structure and multiple predicted structures. 
        The reference structure is the native structure of the RNA molecule. 
        The predicted structures are the molecules to evaluate the quality of.
        The user can input either a `.pdb` file or a `.cif` file. """)

        In the **metric** mode, the user can select around ten metrics.

        - **LCS-TA**: the threshold to use for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Choice is between 10, 15, 20 and 25Â° for the MCQ threshold. 
        - **MCQ**: the mode to use for the computation of the MCQ. Choice is between 
        `Strict` (no computation if any violation is found), `Relaxed` (computation only on non violation parts) and `All` 
        (computation regardless any violation).""")
