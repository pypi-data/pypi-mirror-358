# Polymerization Planner Calculator

A simple Python tool to process Excel sheets and generate ATRP polymerization recipes based on experimental inputs. This can also be applied for PET-RAFT

---

## Features

- Reads Excel files containing polymerization conditions.
- Automatically generates calculated ATRP recipes.
- Saves results in Excel output.

---

## Installation


Clone this repository and install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
Can also access the tutorial by pip install polymerization-planner 
from polymerization-planner import show_tutorial
and then run show_tutorial()

from polymerization-planner import atrp_planner 
from polymerization-planner import pet_raft planner
