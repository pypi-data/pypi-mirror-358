# Staples
Staples is a esoteric language that consists of four characters. This language is built on top of Python, and obfuscates it. Its syntax is binary text, except the hard bracket is zero and the curly bracket is one (facing right). Also, a checksum is required. This is done by copying the the code, reversing it, and making it the opposite bracket (facing left).
