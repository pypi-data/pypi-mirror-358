nsteps = 100000 ; Maximum number of (minimization) steps to perform
integrator = steep ; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol = 100.0 ; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 100.0 kJ/mol/nm
gen_temp = 300 ; initial temperature to avoid zero temperature warnings and artifacts
coulombtype = PME ; Change the electrostatics method from plain cut-off to PME to avoid artifacts
