# Claude Instructions

## Commit Message Preferences
- Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description`
- Common types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- NEVER use the "Generated with Claude Code" footer
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive

## Project Context
- This is a personal budget application built with Textual
- Uses uv for dependency management
- Run tests with: uv run pytest ...
- Look at the Makefile for other helpful commands
- Look at plan.md for planned features and bugs to fix
