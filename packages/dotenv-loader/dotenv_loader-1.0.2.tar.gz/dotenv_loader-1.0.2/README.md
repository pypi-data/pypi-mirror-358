# dotenv-loader

Smart and flexible `.env` loader for Python applications.


## üìñ Overview

**dotenv-loader** provides a flexible yet straightforward way to load environment variables from `.env` files, tailored specifically for Python applications, including Django, Flask, Celery, FastCGI, WSGI, CLI tools, and more. It supports hierarchical configuration, making it extremely convenient to manage multiple environments (development, testing, production) without manually switching `.env` files or cluttering code with environment-specific logic.


## üöÄ Historical Context

Managing environment-specific settings is crucial in modern software development. Standard solutions like [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) simplify loading variables from `.env` files but lack flexible mechanisms for dynamically switching configurations across multiple deployment environments or nested project structures.

dotenv-loader was created specifically to solve these practical challenges:

- Easily switch environments without changing code or manually managing environment variables.
- Support flexible directory structures (such as monorepos or Django sub-applications).
- Enable clear separation of environment-specific configurations, improving clarity and reducing human error.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Hierarchical and prioritized .env file search**: dotenv-loader follows a clear and intuitive priority order:
  1. Explicit path provided via `DOTENV` environment variable.
  2. Configuration directory (`DOTCONFIG_ROOT`) with customizable subdirectories per project and environment stage (`DOTSTAGE`).
  3. Automatic fallback to `.env` file located directly in the project root.

- **Dynamic project and stage selection**: Quickly switch configurations by setting the `DOTPROJECT` and `DOTSTAGE` environment variables, allowing effortless toggling between multiple environments or projects.

- **Customizable file names**: Use custom `.env` filenames to further separate and manage your configurations.


## üîí Security and Best Practices

Storing `.env` files separately in a dedicated configuration directory (`DOTCONFIG_ROOT`) outside your project source tree is a secure and recommended best practice. This approach significantly reduces the risk of accidentally leaking sensitive information (such as API keys, database credentials, etc.) during backups, version control operations, or file transfers. By keeping secrets separate from your codebase, dotenv-loader helps enforce a clear boundary between configuration and code, enhancing security and compliance.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install dotenv-loader
```


## üõ† Usage

### Basic Usage

By default, dotenv-loader automatically identifies the `.env` file from the current project's root directory:

```python
import dotenv_loader

dotenv_loader.load_env()
```


### Advanced Usage

```python
import dotenv_loader

# Load environment with custom default settings 
# Each parameter is optional and first four can be overridden by environment variables:
dotenv_loader.load_env(
    project='mega-project',          # - explicitly set project name
    stage='production',              # - explicitly set stage name
    dotenv='./dir/.env.test'         # - explicitly set .env file 
    config_root='~/custom-configs',  # - custom config directory
    steps_to_project_root=1,         # - how many directories up to look for project root
    default_env_filename='env',      # - change the default '.env' name to you name
    override=True                    # - whether to overwrite existing environment variables 
                                     #   already defined in os.environ. Use False to preserve 
                                     #   values already present (e.g. from OS or CI/CD), or 
                                     #   True to always prefer .env contents.
)
```


### Environment Variables

You can control the behavior of dotenv-loader using the following environment variables:

- **DOTENV** ‚Äî Path to the .env file or directory.
   - If a full file path is given, it overrides all other options. If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.
   - If a directory path is given, the loader will look for an environment file in that directory, based on `default_env_filename` and `DOTSTAGE` (or fallback `stage`).

Examples:

```
DOTENV=/home/user/.env.custom python manage.py
# Uses this exact file; raises an error if not found
 
DOTENV=~/myconfigs/myproject python manage.py
DOTSTAGE=prod
# Loads ~/myconfigs/myproject/.env.prod
 
DOTENV=~/configs/project python manage.py  # calling load_env(stage='local')
# Loads ~/configs/project/.env.local
```

**DOTENV** ‚Äî Specify an explicit path to the .env file:
```bash
DOTENV=/path/to/custom.env python manage.py
```

**DOTPROJECT** ‚Äî Quickly switch between project environments:
```bash
DOTPROJECT=test python manage.py
# Loads: ~/.config/python-projects/test/.env
```

**DOTSTAGE** ‚Äî Select a configuration stage within a project (prod, staging, test):
```bash
DOTSTAGE=staging python manage.py
# Loads: ~/.config/python-projects/myproject/.env.staging
```

**DOTCONFIG_ROOT** ‚Äî Override the default configuration root directory:
```bash
DOTCONFIG_ROOT=~/myconfigs python manage.py
# Loads: ~/myconfigs/myproject/.env
```

**DOTVERBOSE** ‚Äî Print the resolved path of the loaded .env file to stdout:
```bash
DOTVERBOSE=1 python manage.py
# Output: Use DOTENV file from: /home/user/.config/python-projects/projectname/.env 
```


### Typical Directory Structure

```
~/.config/python-projects/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env          # Default configuration (typically a symlink to .env.prod)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.prod     # Production configuration. Use explicitly with: DOTSTAGE=prod python manage.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.staging  # Staging configuration. Use explicitly with: DOTSTAGE=staging python manage.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.test     # Testing configuration. Use explicitly with: DOTSTAGE=test python manage.py

myproject/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py  # By default, loads ~/.config/python-projects/myproject/.env
    .env       # Used only if no .env.* files are found in ~/.config/python-projects/myproject
```

## üßΩ `.env` Resolution Rules and Precedence

`dotenv-loader` uses a deterministic and secure resolution strategy when selecting the appropriate `.env` file to load. The logic ensures maximum flexibility while maintaining clarity and safety.

### Resolution Rules

1. **Environment Variables Take Precedence**

The following environment variables override their corresponding `load_env()` arguments:

- `DOTENV` overrides `dotenv`
- `DOTPROJECT` overrides `project`
- `DOTSTAGE` overrides `stage`
- `DOTCONFIG_ROOT` overrides `config_root`

2. **Relative Paths Are Context-Aware**

- Paths defined in environment variables (e.g., `DOTENV`, `DOTCONFIG_ROOT`) are resolved relative to the current working directory (`PWD`, as seen with `pwd`).
- Paths passed directly to `load_env()` (e.g., `dotenv`, `config_root`) are resolved relative to the calling script's location, adjusted by `steps_to_project_root`.

For example, if manage.py is at `~/projects/proj1/app/manage.py` and `steps_to_project_root=1`, then project_root is considered to be `~/projects/proj1`.

3. **Project and Stage Names Must Be Basenames**

Both `DOTPROJECT`/`project` and `DOTSTAGE`/`stage` must not include slashes. They are treated strictly as simple names (i.e., `Path(name).name`).

4. **Highest Priority: Explicit .env Path or Directory**

If either `DOTENV` or `dotenv` is defined, it takes priority over all other resolution logic.

- If the value is a **full path to a file**, that file is loaded directly. If it doesn't exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised and **no fallback is attempted**.

- If the value is a **directory path**, the loader will **only search within that directory**, constructing the target filename as `[default_env_filename][.stage]`, where `stage` comes from `DOTSTAGE` or the `stage` argument.

5. **Project Name Determination**

The project name is determined as follows:

- If `DOTPROJECT` or `project` is defined, its basename is used

- Otherwise, it defaults to the basename of the computed `project_root` directory

**Note:**

The `project_root` is computed relative to the file that **directly calls** `load_env()`, using the `steps_to_project_root` parameter.

- If `steps_to_project_root=0` (default), `project_root` is the directory containing the calling file
- If `steps_to_project_root=1`, it's the parent of that directory, and so on

For example:

If `load_env()` is called from `~/projects/proj1/app/manage.py` and `steps_to_project_root=1`, then `project_root = ~/projects/proj1`, and the fallback project name is `proj1`.

6. **.env Filename Construction**

The `.env` filename is constructed as:

`"[default_env_filename][[.]STAGE]"`

where:

- `default_env_filename` is `.env` by default
- `STAGE` comes from `DOTSTAGE`or `stage`9 (if defined)

7. **Primary Search Location**

If no explicit file path is provided via `DOTENV`/`dotenv`, the loader checks:

`[DOTCONFIG_ROOT | config_root] / [DOTPROJECT | project] / [default_env_filename][.stage]`

8. **Fallback Location**

If the file is not found in the config directory, a fallback search is performed in the computed project root:
`[project_root] / [default_env_filename][.stage]`

9. **Error Handling**
If no valid `.env` file is found after all resolution attempts, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised. The error message includes a list of all tried paths for easier debugging.
