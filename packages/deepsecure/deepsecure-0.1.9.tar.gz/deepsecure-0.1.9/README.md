## ü§î Why DeepSecure? (Stop Wrestling with Auth & Secrets)

As you build AI agents, you'll quickly run into a familiar, two-part problem:  
1. How do you give your agents access to external APIs securely?  
2. How do you verify *which* agent is making each request?  

The common approach‚Äîhardcoding static `API_KEY`s in `.env` files and writing custom auth logic for every interaction‚Äîis simple at first, but it quickly becomes a fragile, insecure mess that slows you down.

### The Problem: The Mess of Static Keys & Manual Auth

*   **Leaky Keys & Brittle Auth:** A single leaked key compromises an entire system. Your custom token validation logic becomes another surface to attack and a nightmare to maintain and update across services.
*   **Painful Rotation & No Audit Trail:** Rotating keys is a manual headache. When all agents share a key, you have no idea *which* agent performed an action, making debugging and auditing impossible.
*   **All-or-Nothing Access:** Static keys are often over-privileged. Writing the boilerplate code for fine-grained permissions for every agent and every resource is complex and slows down feature development.
*   **Boilerplate Everywhere:** You end up writing the same authentication and authorization logic over and over for each new service your agent needs to talk to, pulling focus away from your core product.

This problem gets exponentially worse as you add more agents and more services. You end up with a complex, fragile web of hardcoded secrets and repetitive auth code that creates security nightmares and kills development velocity.

Before DeepSecure, agent credentials are a tangled mess. Static, long-lived API keys are often shared between multiple agents and manually embedded in configurations. This is not scalable, creates a high risk of key leakage, and makes auditing nearly impossible.

### The DeepSecure Way: Identity-as-Code

DeepSecure solves this by treating **Identity as Code**. Instead of scattering keys, you give each agent a unique, verifiable identity. Your agents then use this identity to request their own short-lived, narrowly-scoped credentials directly from a central service, just-in-time.

With DeepSecure, each agent has its own identity, fetches its own ephemeral credentials, and access is governed by clear, centralized policies. This is scalable, secure, and fully auditable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Get fully set up with DeepSecure in under 5 minutes‚Äîsecure your AI agents instantly!

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Access to an OS keyring (macOS Keychain) for default secure key storage of agent private keys.
*   **Docker and Docker Compose** for running the backend service.

For a complete, step-by-step guide on how to run the backend service, including database setup and Docker commands, please see our [**Credservice Setup Guide**](./docs/credservice-setup.md).

</details>

### Installation

Install DeepSecure using pip:

```bash
pip install deepsecure
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running with DeepSecure in minutes!

The `deepsecure` package you just installed is the client. To use it, you also need its backend service running.
First, let's get the service running.

### 1. Start the `credservice` backend
Before using the SDK or CLI to issue credentials, you need the backend service running. For detailed setup instructions, please follow the [**Credservice Setup Guide**](./docs/credservice-setup.md).

### 2. Configure the CLI to connect to your `credservice`
*(You only need to do this once, or when your `credservice` details change.)*
```bash
# Set the URL of your credservice instance
deepsecure configure set-url http://127.0.0.1:8001

# Securely store your credservice API token.
# When prompted, use the default token for the local setup: DEFAULT_QUICKSTART_TOKEN
deepsecure configure set-token
```

### 3. Store a Secret (via CLI)

Next, you'll need to securely store a long-lived secret (like an API key) in the DeepSecure vault. This is typically an administrative task performed once by a privileged AI developer or an admin on the team.

The CLI will securely prompt you for the secret value so it doesn't appear in your shell history.

```bash
# Store your OpenAI API key in the vault
deepsecure vault store OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### 4. For the AI Agent Developer (Primary Workflow)

This is the recommended way to integrate DeepSecure into your AI agents. You should use the **Python SDK** to handle credentials, as it's safest to keep private keys in memory within the agent's process.

The new SDK is fully object-oriented. You start by creating a `Client`. The examples below show the two main patterns for using it.

**Pattern 1: Basic Workflow**
This pattern is explicit and shows the full sequence of creating a client, ensuring an agent identity exists, and then fetching a secret on its behalf.

```python
import deepsecure

# 1. Initialize the client.
client = deepsecure.Client()

# 2. Ensure an agent identity exists, creating it if it doesn't.
#    This returns an Agent object, which is a handle to the identity.
agent = client.agent("my-first-agent", auto_create=True)

# 3. Use the agent's identity to securely fetch a secret.
try:
    api_key_secret = client.get_secret(
        name="OPENAI_API_KEY",
        agent_name=agent.name
    )
    # The .value property gives you the secret. The object itself won't
    # print the value, to prevent accidental logging.
    print(f"Secret fetched! Value starts with: '{api_key_secret.value[:4]}...'")

except deepsecure.DeepSecureError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Pattern 2: Recommended Workflow (Cleaner & More Scoped)**

For cleaner code, especially when an agent performs multiple actions, create an agent-specific client context using `.with_agent()`.

```python
import deepsecure

# 1. Initialize the main client.
client = deepsecure.Client()

# 2. Create a client scoped specifically to the "my-first-agent" identity.
#    All subsequent calls on `agent_client` act on behalf of this agent.
agent_client = client.with_agent("my-first-agent", auto_create=True)

# 3. Now, you don't need to pass `agent_name` to `get_secret`.
api_key_secret = agent_client.get_secret("OPENAI_API_KEY")

print(f"Secret fetched with agent-specific client! Value starts with: '{api_key_secret.value[:4]}...'")
```
