# examples/04_crewai_secure_tools_without_finegrain_control.py
"""
This example demonstrates how to securely integrate DeepSecure with CrewAI
using a "Tool Factory" pattern with dependency injection.

This version works immediately without requiring fine-grained policy setup.
All agents share access to all secrets (permissive mode), but the example
still demonstrates the professional patterns for secure tool creation.

Prerequisites:
1. `pip install 'deepsecure[frameworks]'` (to install crewai)
2. A running DeepSecure `credservice` backend.
3. Your DeepSecure CLI is configured (`deepsecure configure`).
4. You have stored secrets in the vault, e.g.,
   `deepsecure vault store notion-api-key --value "your-notion-key"`
   `deepsecure vault store tavily-api-key --value "your-tavily-key"`

Note: This example demonstrates the tool factory pattern and framework integration.
In a production environment with fine-grained policies, each agent would be
restricted to only their authorized secrets.
