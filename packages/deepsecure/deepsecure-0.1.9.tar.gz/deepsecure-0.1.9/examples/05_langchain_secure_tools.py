# examples/05_langchain_secure_tools.py
"""
This example demonstrates how to build secure, fine-grained tools for LangChain
agents using the DeepSecure SDK.

🚨 **IMPORTANT - FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY DEMONSTRATION**
This example showcases the PLANNED fine-grained policy system where each 
agent can have different security policies and access only to the secrets 
they need. This requires the `deepsecure policy create` command to be 
implemented first.

**Current Status**: This example will NOT work until the policy management
system is fully implemented. For a working LangChain example, see:
`06_langchain_secure_tools_without_finegrain_control.py`

**Future Vision**: It showcases the "Tool Factory" and "Dependency Injection" 
patterns, where each tool is created with an agent-specific DeepSecure client 
context. This ensures that each tool can only access the secrets its designated 
agent is authorized for, enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege.

**Planned Scenario:**
- We have two agents: a "researcher" and a "writer".
- The "researcher" needs access to a search tool that uses a Tavily API key.
- The "writer" needs access to a publishing tool that uses a Notion API key.
- We will create policies ensuring the researcher can ONLY access the Tavily key,
  and the writer can ONLY access the Notion key.

**To Run This Example (when implemented):**
1. Make sure the `credservice` backend is running.
2. Set up the necessary agents and policies using the DeepSecure CLI:
   ```bash
   # Create agent identities
   deepsecure agent register --name researcher
   deepsecure agent register --name writer

   # Store the secrets in the vault
   deepsecure vault store tavily_api_key --value "tvly-your-real-or-dummy-key"
   deepsecure vault store notion_api_key --value "secret_your-real-or-dummy-key"

   # Create fine-grained access policies
   deepsecure policy create --agent-name researcher --secret-name tavily_api_key --action read
   deepsecure policy create --agent-name writer --secret-name notion_api_key --action read
   ```
3. Install langchain-community:
    ```bash
    pip install langchain-community
    ```
