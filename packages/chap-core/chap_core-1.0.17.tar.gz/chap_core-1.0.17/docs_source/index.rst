The Chap Modeling Platform
==============================================================

The Chap Modeling Platform is a platform for forecasting and for assessing forecasts of climate-sensitive health outcomes.
In the early phase, the focus is on vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.

The platform can perform data parsing, data integration, forecasting based on any of
multiple supported models, automatic brokering of compatible models for a given prediction context and robust forecast assessment and method comparison.

**Chap Core** is the name of the `backend service <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core>`_ and the `Python package <https://pypi.org/project/chap-core/>`_ in the Chap Modeling Platform. This website contains documentation about how to use Chap Core for **modelers**, **contributors**, **developers**, and **system administrators wanting to use Chap with DHIS2/Modeling App**. For more general information about the Chap project, we refer you to `the Chap Modelling Platform wiki <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core/wiki>`_.
