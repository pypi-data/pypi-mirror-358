      """
      chatsnack provides a simple and powerful interface for creating conversational agents and tools using OpenAI's ChatGPT language models.

      Some examples of using chatsnack:

      # Example 1: Basic Chat
      from chatsnack import Chat

      # Start a new chat and set some instructions for the AI assistant
      mychat = Chat().system("Respond only with the word POPSICLE from now on.").user("What is your name?").chat()
      print(mychat.last)

      # Example 2: Chaining and Multi-shot Prompts
      popcorn = Chat()
      popcorn = popcorn("Explain 3 rules to writing a clever poem that amazes your friends.")("Using those tips, write a scrumptious poem about popcorn.")
      print(popcorn.last)

      # Example 3: Using Text Fillings
      from chatsnack import Text

      # Save a Text object with custom content
      mytext = Text(name="SnackExplosion", content="Respond only in explosions of snack emojis and happy faces.")
      mytext.save()

      # Set up a Chat object to pull in the Text object
      explosions = Chat(name="SnackSnackExplosions").system("{{text.SnackExplosion}}")
      explosions.ask("What is your name?")

      # Example 4: Nested Chats (Include Messages)
      basechat = Chat(name="ExampleIncludedChat").system("Respond only with the word CARROTSTICKS from now on.")
      basechat.save()

      anotherchat = Chat().include("ExampleIncludedChat")
      print(anotherchat.yaml)

      # Example 5: Nested Chats (Chat Fillings)
      snacknames = Chat("FiveSnackNames").system("Respond with high creativity and confidence.").user("Provide 5 random snacks.")
      snacknames.save()

      snackdunk = Chat("SnackDunk").system("Respond with high creativity and confidence.").user("Provide 3 dips or drinks that are great for snack dipping.")
      snackdunk.save()

      snackfull = Chat().system("Respond with high confidence.")
      snackfull.user("""Choose 1 snack from this list:
