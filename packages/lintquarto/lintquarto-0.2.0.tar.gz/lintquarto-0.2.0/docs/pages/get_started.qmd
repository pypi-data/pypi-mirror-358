## Installation

Python 3.7 or higher is required. `lintquarto` itself has no dependencies.

Install `lintquarto` with:

```{.bash}
pip install lintquarto
```

Linters are installed separately. For example, to use `pylint` and `flake8`, run:

```{.bash}
pip install pylint flake8
```

If you want to install `lintquarto` along with all supported linters, use:

```{.bash}
pip install lintquarto[all]
```

You can verify your installation with:

```{.bash}
lintquarto --version
```

## Basic usage

```{.bash}
lintquarto [linter] [files or folders] [-k | --keep-temp]
```

* **[linter]** - Choose one of the supported linters: `pylint`, `flake8`, `pyflakes`, `ruff`, `pylama`, `vulture`, `radon`, `pycodestyle`, `mypy`, `pyright`, `pyrefly`, or `pytype`

* **[files or folders]** - One or more `.qmd` files or directories to lint.
* **-k, --keep-temp** - Keep the temporary `.py` files created during linting (for debugging).

Only one linter can be specified per command. Passing extra arguments directly to linters is not supported. Only `.qmd` files are processed.

## Examples

The linter used is interchangeable in these examples.

Lint all `.qmd` files in the current directory (using `pylint`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto pylint .
```

Lint a specific file (using `flake8`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto flake8 file.qmd
```

Lint several specific files (using `pylint`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto pylint file1.qmd file2.qmd
```

Lint all `.qmd` files in a folder (using `mypy`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto mypy folder
```

Keep temporary `.py` files after linting (with `pylint`)

```{.bash}
lintquarto pylint . -k
```
