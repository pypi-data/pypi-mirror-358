The ORCA Python Interface (OPI) is a Python library to create input and parse output of [ORCA](https://www.faccts.de/orca/). It is designed as an open source community effort to make ORCA calculations as accessible as possible and is consistently supported by [FACCTs](https://www.faccts.de/), the co-developers of the ORCA quantum chemistry program package. Note that OPI is first introduced with ORCA 6.1 and is not compatible with earlier versions.

## Installation

This package can either be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/orca-pi/) with:

```
pip install orca-pi
```

or from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/faccts/opi.git
cd opi
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
```

More details about the installation can be found in the [documentation](https://www.faccts.de/docs/opi/1.0/docs/contents/install.html).

### ORCA and Open MPI

OPI requires ORCA and for parallel calculations also Open MPI.
Details on how to install ORCA can be found its manual or tutorials. See [Helpful Links](#Helpful-Links).
For most modern operating system Open MPI can usually be installed directly with the systems package manager.
Otherwise, a suitable version has be obtained and compiled from their [website](https://www.open-mpi.org/).

**Note that OPI is first introduced with ORCA 6.1 and is not compatible with earlier versions.
The minimal supported ORCA version is always stored in [ORCA_MINIMAL_VERSION](https://github.com/faccts/opi/blob/main/src/opi/__init__.py)**

## Documentation

This package comes with a set of tutorials and automatic API reference.
The files can be found in [docs/](https://github.com/faccts/opi/tree/main/docs).
We also host the documentation for the latest stable release and nightly version online.
See [Helpful Links](#Helpful-Links).

The documentation can also be built from the `docs/` folder:

```
make html
```

This requires [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) which by default is also installed by the `Makefile`.
