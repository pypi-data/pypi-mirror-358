PynamoDB Context Manager for Using Specific Boto3 Sessions

This module provides a context manager that allows PynamoDB models to temporarily
use different AWS credentials/sessions without modifying the model definition.
This is particularly useful for:

- Multi-account operations
- Different AWS profiles for different environments
- Temporary credential switching
- Cross-account DynamoDB operations

    Context manager to temporarily switch PynamoDB model to use different AWS credentials.

    This context manager allows a PynamoDB model to temporarily use different AWS
    credentials by leveraging the boto-session-manager's awscli() context manager
    and manipulating the model's connection and region settings.

    :param bsm: The boto session manager instance containing the
        target AWS credentials/profile to use.
        See https://pypi.org/project/boto-session-manager/
    :param table: The PynamoDB model class that will use the new credentials.
    :param restore_on_exit: If True, restore original connection on exit
        if False, keep current connection for subsequent operations.
        See also :func:`reset_connection`.

    :yields: None, This is a context manager that doesn't return a value

    Usage::

        # Define your model
        class MyModel(Model):
            class Meta:
                table_name = "my_table"
                region = "us-east-1"

            id = NumberAttribute(hash_key=True)

        # Use different credentials temporarily
        target_bsm = BotoSesManager(profile_name="target_profile")

        with target_aws_cred(target_bsm, MyModel):
            # All operations here use the target_profile credentials
            MyModel.create_table()
            item = MyModel(id=1)
            item.save()

        # Back to original credentials
        items = MyModel.scan()  # This uses default credentials

    How it works:

    1. Saves the current region setting from the model's Meta class
    2. Enters the boto session manager's awscli() context (sets env vars)
    3. Clears the model's cached connection to force recreation
    4. Updates the model's region to match the session manager's region
    5. Creates a new Connection object with the new region
    6. On exit, restores the original region and clears connection again

    .. note::

        - The model's _connection attribute is set to None to force PynamoDB
            to create a new connection with the current environment variables
        - The region is temporarily changed to ensure consistency with the session
        - All changes are reverted when exiting the context manager when restore_on_exit is True

            # All PynamoDB operations within this context will use the new credentials
            yield None

        if restore_on_exit:
