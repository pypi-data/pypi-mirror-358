# exteraGram Utils

Development utilities for exteraGram plugins.

## Installation

```bash
pip install exteragram-utils
```

## Usage

Run the development client:

```bash
extera [plugin_files...]
```

## Type Imports

After installation, you can import types directly:

```python
from base_plugin import BasePlugin
from ui.settings import Switch
```

Note: The typing stub files are installed at the root level of your Python environment to allow direct imports without
the `exteragram_utils` prefix.
