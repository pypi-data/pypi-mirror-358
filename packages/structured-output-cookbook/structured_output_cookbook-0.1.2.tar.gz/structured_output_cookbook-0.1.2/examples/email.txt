Subject: Urgent: API Migration Deadline Extension Request
Date: March 15, 2024 2:30 PM PST
Priority: High

Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing regarding the upcoming API migration project deadline scheduled for March 30th.

MAIN ISSUE:
Our development team has encountered several critical issues during the migration process that require immediate attention:

1. Database schema conflicts between v1 and v2 APIs
2. Authentication system incompatibilities 
3. Third-party integration failures with Stripe and SendGrid
4. Performance degradation in the staging environment

ACTION ITEMS NEEDED:
- Emergency team meeting tomorrow (March 16th) at 10 AM in Conference Room B
- Extended testing period for the new authentication system
- Coordination with DevOps team for infrastructure scaling
- Client communication strategy for potential service interruptions

QUESTIONS FOR THE TEAM:
1. Can we realistically complete testing by April 15th instead of March 30th?
2. Do we have budget approval for additional AWS resources during migration?
3. Should we consider a phased rollout approach to minimize risks?

REQUESTED DEADLINE EXTENSION:
Based on current progress and identified issues, I'm formally requesting a 2-week extension to April 15th. This will allow us to:
- Properly test all integrations
- Implement proper rollback procedures
- Ensure zero downtime migration
- Complete comprehensive documentation

The current timeline puts our production systems at risk. A failed migration could result in significant downtime and potential revenue loss estimated at $50,000 per hour.

NEXT STEPS:
Please respond by end of day with your availability for tomorrow's meeting. We need to make a decision quickly to communicate any changes to our client, Acme Corporation, who is expecting the new API features.

Contact me directly at (555) 123-4567 if you have any urgent concerns.

Thanks for your understanding and support.
