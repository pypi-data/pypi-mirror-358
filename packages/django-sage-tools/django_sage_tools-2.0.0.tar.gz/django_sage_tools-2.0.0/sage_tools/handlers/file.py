    This class provides methods to identify file fields in a model, delete old

    process based on application settings and model instance states.

    Methods
    -------
    is_file_field(field):
        Determine if the given field is a file field.

    delete_old_file(old_instance, field_name):
        Delete the file from the specified field in the provided instance.

        Conduct a check and delete operation for file fields of the given model instance.

        ----------
        field : django.db.models.fields
            A Django model field to be checked against file field types.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if the field is a FileField, ImageField, or a custom ImageField
            from `sorl.thumbnail`, otherwise False.

        This method directly interacts with the file system to delete files and should
