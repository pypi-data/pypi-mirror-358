"""This module provides middleware support for handling user language
preferences in a Django web application.

It extends Django's built-in locale middleware functionality, offering a
more nuanced approach to language detection and selection through URL
prefixes and cookies. The core component, CookieLocaleMiddleware,
intercepts web requests to determine the most suitable language for the
user and adjust the request or response accordingly.

    The middleware determines the user's preferred language by examining
    the URL and cookies, then aligns the request with the determined
    preference. It's designed to work seamlessly with multilingual
    sites, redirecting users to the appropriate language version of the

        based on the URL or cookies.

        This method checks the request path for language prefixes (e.g., '/en/', '/fr/')
        and compares it with the language specified in the user's language cookie.
        It activates the appropriate language for the session and redirects to a URL
        that matches the preferred language if necessary.

        Example:
            When a user accesses a URL like '/es/about/', but their language cookie
            is set to 'en', this method will redirect them to '/en/about/' if
            English is an available language. Conversely, if the URL is '/about/' with no
            language prefix and the cookie is set to 'es', the user will be redirected to '/es/about/'.

        Parameters:
            request: HttpRequest object containing metadata about the request.

        Returns:
            A redirect response if the language from the URL and cookie differ, otherwise None.
