class CacheControlMixin:
    """Mixin that allows setting Cache-Control options for Django class-based
    views.

    This mixin enables specifying various Cache-Control headers as class attributes on the view class.
    The available options include:
    - public: Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.
    - private: Indicates that the response is intended for a single user and must not be stored by shared caches.
    - no_cache: Forces caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy.
    - no_transform: Prohibits intermediate caches from modifying the response content.
    - must_revalidate: Indicates that once a cached response becomes stale, it must not be used again without successful validation on the origin server.
    - proxy_revalidate: Similar to must_revalidate, but only for shared caches.
    - max_age: Specifies the maximum amount of time a resource is considered fresh.
    - s_maxage: Overrides max_age or the Expires header for shared caches (e.g., proxies).

    Use-Cases:
    - When you need to control how a view's response is cached by browsers and intermediary caches.
    - Useful for views serving static content that can be cached for performance improvement.
    - Applicable in scenarios where cache invalidation and freshness need to be finely managed.

    Example Usage:
    class MyCacheControlledView(CacheControlMixin, TemplateView):
        template_name = 'my_template.html'
        cachecontrol_public = True
        cachecontrol_max_age = 3600  # 1 hour

class NeverCacheMixin:
    """Mixin that applies Django's `never_cache` view decorator to prevent
    HTTP-based caching.

    This mixin ensures that the response from the view it is applied to will never be cached by setting
    the Cache-Control header to 'no-cache'. This is useful for views that deliver highly dynamic content
    or sensitive data that should not be stored in any cache.

    Use-Cases:
    - When you need to ensure that the content is always fresh and never stored by browsers or intermediary caches.
    - Useful for views serving user-specific data, such as dashboards or forms where data changes frequently.
    - Applicable in scenarios where data privacy and up-to-date content are critical.

    Example Usage:
    class MyNeverCachedView(NeverCacheMixin, TemplateView):
        template_name = 'my_template.html'

    """
