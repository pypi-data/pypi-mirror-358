class RatingMixin(models.Model):
    """An abstract base class model designed to add a rating functionality to
    any model that requires it. This mixin introduces a standardized way to
    capture user ratings for various objects within the application, ensuring
    consistency and reusability across different parts of the system.

    The rating system implemented by this mixin allows for granular
    feedback, supporting not only whole numbers but also half-point
    increments within a defined range from 1 to 5. This flexibility
    accommodates a wide range of rating scenarios, from product reviews
    to service evaluations, enhancing the application's ability to
    gather and reflect nuanced user feedback.

    As an abstract model, RatingMixin does not create a database table
    on its own but serves as a building block for other models, allowing
    them to easily integrate a uniform rating system without the need
    for redundant code.
