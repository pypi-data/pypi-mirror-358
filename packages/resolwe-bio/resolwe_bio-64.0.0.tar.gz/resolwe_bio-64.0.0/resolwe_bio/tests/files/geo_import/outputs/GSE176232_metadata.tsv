EBNA2 ChIP-seq: EBNA2+ (B95.8) EBV infected Ramos B cells replicate 1	SRX11078224	EBNA2 ChIP-seq: EBNA2+ (B95.8) EBV infected Ramos B cells replicate 1	GSM5360535	Public on Sep 23 2021	Jun 06 2021	Oct 23 2023	SRA	1	Ramos B cells	Homo sapiens	9606	Ramos B cells	EBNA+ (B95.8) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)	EBNA2 (Abcam; ab90543)	Ramos B cells were infected with EBNA+ (B95.8) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).	Cells were cultured in 10% FBS supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for 2 weeks.	genomic DNA	Cells were crosslinked and nuclei were sonicated as described previously (Lu et al. 2015). Libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).	ChIP_EBNA2_Ramos_rep1-E02333	Datasets were processed and analyzed using an in-house automated pipeline (https://github.com/MarioPujato/NextGenAligner); the following steps describe briefly the characteristics of the NextGenAligner pipeline. Basic quality control for raw sequencing reads was performed using FASTQC (version 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). The quality controlled reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19 and hg38) using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Adapter sequences were removed using Trim Galore (version 0.4.2) (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), a wrapper script that runs cutadapt (version 1.9.1) to remove the detected adapter sequence from the reads. Aligned reads were then sorted using samtools (version 1.8) (Li et al., 2009) and duplicate reads were removed using picard (version 1.89) (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Peaks were called using MACS2 (version 2.1.0) (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS) (Zhang et al., 2008). ENCODE blacklist regions (Amemiya et al., 2019) were removed using the hg19-blacklist.v2.bed.gz file available at https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/tree/master/lists. Pooled samples were created by combining the fastq files for replicates 1 and 2.
