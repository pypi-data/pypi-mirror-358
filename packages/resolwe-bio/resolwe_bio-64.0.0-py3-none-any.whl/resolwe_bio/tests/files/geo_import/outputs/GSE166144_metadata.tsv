Vector	SRX10020940	Vector	GSM5062258	Public on Feb 09 2021	Feb 04 2021	Feb 09 2021	SRA	1	HepG2 cells	Homo sapiens	9606	HepG2	Liver	Vector	HepG2 cells were transfected with vector or FLAG-JFK or treated with control siRNA or ING5 siRNA.	HepG2 cells were maintained according to the ATCC’s recommendation.	total RNA	Total mRNAs were isolated with Trizol reagents (Invitrogen) for cDNA synthesis, library construction, and sequencing using HiSeq 2500. RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols.	Control	Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling. The quality of raw data was examined by FastQC, and sequencing adapter and low-quality reads, i.e. those with more than five ‘N’ bases and mean Phred quality score less than 15, were removed through fastp. Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software was utilized to align clean reads to the unmasked human reference genome (GRCh37, hg19). Raw counts of the reads mapped to genes were selected to analyze differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 Bioconductor package.
