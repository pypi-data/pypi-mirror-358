# Raster Feature Extractor

A CLI tool and Python library for extracting vector features from geospatial raster (TIF) files using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and exporting them as GeoJSON.

## Installation

```bash
pip install orthomasker
```

## Usage

```bash
# Using CLI
orthomasker your_input_filename.tif your_output_filename.geojson

# Using Python
from orthomasker.feature_extractor import RasterFeatureExtractor

# Provide your own test TIF file (upload or use a sample)
input_tif = "your_input_filename.tif"
output_geojson = "your_output_filename.geojson"

# Set up the extractor (use the path to your .pth file)
extractor = RasterFeatureExtractor()

extractor.convert(input_tif, output_geojson)
```

### Options

- `--sam-checkpoint`: Path to SAM model weights (default: sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth)

- `--model-type`: SAM model type (`vit_h`, `vit_l`, `vit_b`; default: vit_h)

- `--confidence-threshold`: Minimum stability score to keep a mask (0–100; default: 0, no filter)

- `--tile-size`: Tile size for processing (default: 1024)

- `--overlap`: Tile overlap in pixels (default: 128)

- `--class-name`: Class label for output features (default: sam_object)

- `--min-area`: Minimum area (in square units of TIF CRS) for output features (optional)

- `--max-area`: Maximum area (in square units of TIF CRS) for output features (optional)

- `--compactness`: Minimum compactness threshold (0.0–1.0) using Polsby-Popper metric for filtering irregular shapes (optional)

- `--fixed-bounds`: Bounding box (minx, miny, maxx, maxy) in image CRS

- `--merge`: Merge overlapping polygons in output (optional)

- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output

## Compactness Filtering

The `--compactness` option allows you to filter out irregular or elongated shapes by setting a minimum compactness threshold. This uses the Polsby-Popper compactness metric:
<br>
`Compactness = (4π × Area) / (Perimeter²)`

Perfect circle: compactness = 1.0
Square: compactness ≈ 0.785
Elongated shapes: compactness approaches 0.0

Common threshold values:

0.1: Very permissive (removes only extremely irregular shapes)
0.3: Moderate filtering (removes highly irregular shapes)
0.6: Strict filtering (keeps only relatively compact shapes)
0.8: Very strict (keeps only very round/square shapes)

## Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickmccarty/orthomasker.git
cd orthomasker
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[ml,dev]"
```

## Acknowledgments

This project leverages [Meta AI’s Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) for automatic mask generation, which is faciliated by utilizing [`segment-anything-py`](https://pypi.org/project/segment-anything-py/) as a dependency; many thanks to Wu, Q. et al. for their work!
