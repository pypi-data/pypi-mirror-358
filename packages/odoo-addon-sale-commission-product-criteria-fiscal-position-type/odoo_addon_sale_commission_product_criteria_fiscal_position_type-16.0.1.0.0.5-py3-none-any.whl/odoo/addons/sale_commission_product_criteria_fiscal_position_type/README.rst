Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Commissions > Configuration > Commission Types.
2. Create or open a Commission Type with type = "Product criteria".
3. Open or create a rule, appart from the "Apply On" field, you can fill
   the "Fiscal Position Type" to filter whose customers this rule will
   be applied to. If the field is empty, it will be applied to all
   customers.
4. The rules will be sorted according to his priority, rules with fiscal
   position types are more prioritary than rules without it.

When selling or invoicing to a customer, Odoo will query the commission
rules, filtering by the fiscal position type of the customer if set.
Before that, odoo will apply the first commission rule found, as it is
done in the sale_commission_product_criteria module.
