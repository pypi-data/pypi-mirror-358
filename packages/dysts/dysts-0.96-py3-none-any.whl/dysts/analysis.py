    Estimates the largest Lyapunov exponent using the algorithm of Rosenstein
    et al. [lr_1]_.
    Explanation of Lyapunov exponents:
        See lyap_e.
    Explanation of the algorithm:
        The algorithm of Rosenstein et al. is only able to recover the largest
        Lyapunov exponent, but behaves rather robust to parameter choices.
        The idea for the algorithm relates closely to the definition of Lyapunov
        exponents. First, the dynamics of the data are reconstructed using a delay
        embedding method with a lag, such that each value x_i of the data is mapped
        to the vector
        X_i = [x_i, x_(i+lag), x_(i+2*lag), ..., x_(i+(emb_dim-1) * lag)]
        For each such vector X_i, we find the closest neighbor X_j using the
        euclidean distance. We know that as we follow the trajectories from X_i and
        X_j in time in a chaotic system the distances between X_(i+k) and X_(j+k)
        denoted as d_i(k) will increase according to a power law
        d_i(k) = c * e^(lambda * k) where lambda is a good approximation of the
        highest Lyapunov exponent, because the exponential expansion along the axis
        associated with this exponent will quickly dominate the expansion or
        contraction along other axes.
        To calculate lambda, we look at the logarithm of the distance trajectory,
        because log(d_i(k)) = log(c) + lambda * k. This gives a set of lines
        (one for each index i) whose slope is an approximation of lambda. We
        therefore extract the mean log trajectory d'(k) by taking the mean of
        log(d_i(k)) over all orbit vectors X_i. We then fit a straight line to
        the plot of d'(k) versus k. The slope of the line gives the desired
        parameter lambda.

    Method for choosing min_tsep:
        Usually we want to find neighbors between points that are close in phase
        space but not too close in time, because we want to avoid spurious
        correlations between the obtained trajectories that originate from temporal
        dependencies rather than the dynamic properties of the system. Therefore it
        is critical to find a good value for min_tsep. One rather plausible
        estimate for this value is to set min_tsep to the mean period of the
        signal, which can be obtained by calculating the mean frequency using the
        fast fourier transform. This procedure is used by default if the user sets
        min_tsep = None.

    Method for choosing lag:
        Another parameter that can be hard to choose by instinct alone is the lag
        between individual values in a vector of the embedded orbit. Here,
        Rosenstein et al. suggest to set the lag to the distance where the
        autocorrelation function drops below 1 - 1/e times its original (maximal)
        value. This procedure is used by default if the user sets lag = None.

    Performs a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the given data
    Recommendations for parameter settings by Hardstone et al.:
        * nvals should be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale so that each window
            scale hase the same weight
        * min(nvals) < 4 does not make much sense as fitting a polynomial (even if
            it is only of order 1) to 3 or less data points is very prone.
        * max(nvals) > len(data) / 10 does not make much sense as we will then have
            less than 10 windows to calculate the average fluctuation
        * use overlap=True to obtain more windows and therefore better statistics
            (at an increased computational cost)

    Explanation of DFA:
        Detrended fluctuation analysis, much like the Hurst exponent, is used to
        find long-term statistical dependencies in time series.
        The idea behind DFA originates from the definition of self-affine
        processes. A process X is said to be self-affine if the standard deviation
        of the values within a window of length n changes with the window length
        factor L in a power law:
        std(X,L * n) = L^H * std(X, n)
        where std(X, k) is the standard deviation of the process X calculated over
        windows of size k. In this equation, H is called the Hurst parameter, which
        behaves indeed very similar to the Hurst exponent.
        Like the Hurst exponent, H can be obtained from a time series by
        calculating std(X,n) for different n and fitting a straight line to the
        plot of log(std(X,n)) versus log(n).
        To calculate a single std(X,n), the time series is split into windows of
        equal length n, so that the ith window of this size has the form
        W_(n,i) = [x_i, x_(i+1), x_(i+2), ... x_(i+n-1)]
        The value std(X,n) is then obtained by calculating std(W_(n,i)) for each i
        and averaging the obtained values over i.
        The aforementioned definition of self-affinity, however, assumes that the
        process is    non-stationary (i.e. that the standard deviation changes over
        time) and it is highly influenced by local and global trends of the time
        series.
        To overcome these problems, an estimate alpha of H is calculated by using a
        "walk" or "signal profile" instead of the raw time series. This walk is
        obtained by substracting the mean and then taking the cumulative sum of the
        original time series. The local trends are removed for each window
        separately by fitting a polynomial p_(n,i) to the window W_(n,i) and then
        calculating W'_(n,i) = W_(n,i) - p_(n,i) (element-wise substraction).
        We then calculate std(X,n) as before only using the "detrended" window
        W'_(n,i) instead of W_(n,i). Instead of H we obtain the parameter alpha
        from the line fitting.
        For alpha < 1 the underlying process is stationary and can be modelled as
        fractional Gaussian noise with H = alpha. This means for alpha = 0.5 we
        have no correlation or "memory", for 0.5 < alpha < 1 we have a memory with
        positive correlation and for alpha < 0.5 the correlation is negative.
        For alpha > 1 the underlying process is non-stationary and can be modeled
        as fractional Brownian motion with H = alpha - 1.

        c_min: min value for c parameter, defaults to pi/5
