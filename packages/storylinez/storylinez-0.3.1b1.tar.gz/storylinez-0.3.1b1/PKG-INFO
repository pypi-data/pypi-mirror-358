For the latest features or development work:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kawai-Senpai/Storylinez-SDK.git
cd Storylinez-SDK
pip install -e .
```

## Authentication

### Using Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:

```
STORYLINEZ_API_KEY=api_your_key_here
STORYLINEZ_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
STORYLINEZ_ORG_ID=your_org_id_here
```

Then load these credentials:

```python
from storylinez import StorylinezClient
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load credentials from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the client
client = StorylinezClient(
    api_key=os.environ.get("STORYLINEZ_API_KEY"),
    api_secret=os.environ.get("STORYLINEZ_API_SECRET"),
    org_id=os.environ.get("STORYLINEZ_ORG_ID")
)
```

### Direct Initialization

You can also initialize the client directly:

```python
from storylinez import StorylinezClient

# Initialize with explicit credentials
client = StorylinezClient(
    api_key="api_your_key_here",
    api_secret="your_secret_here",
    org_id="your_org_id_here"
)

# Initialize with custom API endpoint (for enterprise customers)
client = StorylinezClient(
    api_key="api_your_key_here",
    api_secret="your_secret_here",
    org_id="your_org_id_here",
    base_url="https://your-custom-endpoint.storylinez.com"
)
```

### Multiple Organizations

If you work with multiple organizations, you can:

```python
# Initialize client without default org_id
client = StorylinezClient(
    api_key="api_your_key_here",
    api_secret="your_secret_here"
)

# Specify organization per operation
project = client.project.create_project(
    name="Project Name",
    orientation="landscape",
    org_id="specific_org_id_here"
)

# Or set a new default
client.set_default_org_id("different_org_id")
```

## Quick Start

### End-to-End Video Creation

This example shows the complete process of creating a video from a text prompt:

```python
from storylinez import StorylinezClient
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Setup
load_dotenv()
client = StorylinezClient()

# 1. Create a project
project = client.project.create_project(
    name="Product Introduction",
    orientation="landscape",
    purpose="Introduce our new sustainable product line"
)
project_id = project["project"]["project_id"]

# 2. Create a text prompt
client.prompt.create_text_prompt(
    project_id=project_id,
    main_prompt="Create a 30-second video introducing our eco-friendly product line that reduces plastic waste by 75%",
    document_context="Our products are made from bamboo and recycled materials. The target audience is environmentally conscious millennials.",
    temperature=0.7,
    total_length=30
)

# 3. Generate a storyboard
storyboard_job = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    deepthink=True,
    web_search=True
)
print(f"Storyboard job started: {storyboard_job['job_id']}")

# 4. Wait for storyboard completion
storyboard = client.storyboard.wait_for_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=300,
    polling_interval=5
)
print(f"Storyboard created with {len(storyboard['scenes'])} scenes")

# 5. Create a sequence
sequence_job = client.sequence.create_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    apply_template=True,
    apply_grade=True
)
print(f"Sequence job started: {sequence_job['job_id']}")

# 6. Wait for sequence completion
sequence = client.sequence.get_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    include_results=True
)
while sequence.get("status") != "COMPLETED":
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
    sequence = client.sequence.get_sequence(project_id=project_id)
print("Sequence completed")

# 7. Render the final video
render_job = client.render.create_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    target_width=1920,
    target_height=1080,
    subtitle_enabled=True,
    company_name="Eco Solutions Inc.",
    call_to_action="Visit eco-solutions.com today"
)
print(f"Render job started: {render_job['job_id']}")

# 8. Get the download link when complete
render = client.render.wait_for_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=1800,
    polling_interval=20
)
if render["status"] == "COMPLETED":
    download_info = client.render.get_render(
        project_id=project_id,
        generate_download_link=True,
        generate_streamable_link=True
    )
    print(f"Video ready! Download URL: {download_info['download_url']}")
    print(f"Stream URL: {download_info['streamable_url']}")
else:
    print(f"Render failed with status: {render['status']}")
```

### Following the Workflow: Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's walk through each step of the flowchart with practical code examples:

#### 1. Upload Files (Optional)
Start by uploading any custom media you want to use in your project:

```python
# Upload custom videos, images, or audio
media_result = client.storage.upload_file(
    file_path="./product_demo.mp4",
    folder_path="/my_project_assets",
    tags=["product", "demo", "brand"],
    analyze_video=True,  # Enable content analysis
    generate_thumbnail=True
)
file_id = media_result["file"]["file_id"]
print(f"Uploaded file with ID: {file_id}")

# For multiple files
files_to_upload = ["./logo.png", "./background_music.mp3", "./team_photo.jpg"]
for file_path in files_to_upload:
    client.storage.upload_file(
        file_path=file_path,
        folder_path="/my_project_assets"
    )
```

**Practical Tip**: Upload high-quality source materials in the highest resolution available. The SDK will automatically optimize them during the rendering process.

#### 2. Create Project
Set up the foundation for your video:

```python
# Create a new project 
project = client.project.create_project(
    name="Product Launch Video",
    orientation="landscape",  # Use "portrait" for vertical videos (social media)
    purpose="Introduce our new sustainable product line",
    target_audience="Eco-conscious consumers aged 25-45"
)
project_id = project["project"]["project_id"]
```

**When to use**: Always start here. This creates the container for all your video assets and settings.

#### 3. Add Files
Associate your uploaded files or stock media with your project:

```python
# Add your custom uploaded files
if file_id:  # From previous upload step
    client.project.add_associated_file(
        project_id=project_id,
        file_id=file_id
    )

# Find and add stock videos
stock_videos = client.stock.search(
    queries=["sustainable products", "eco friendly lifestyle"],
    collections=["videos"],
    detailed=True,
    num_results_videos=5,
    orientation="landscape"
)

# Add selected stock videos to your project
for video in stock_videos["videos"][:3]:  # Add first 3 results
    client.project.add_stock_file(
        project_id=project_id,
        stock_id=video["stock_id"],
        media_type="videos"
    )
```

**Practical Tip**: Mixing custom and stock media creates unique, brand-specific videos. Consider uploading your logo, product shots, and team photos.

#### 4. Create Prompt
Tell the AI what your video should be about:

```python
# Define your video content with natural language
client.prompt.create_text_prompt(
    project_id=project_id,
    main_prompt="Create a 30-second video introducing our eco-friendly product line that reduces plastic waste by 75%. Show the products in use, highlight their environmental benefits, and include testimonials.",
    document_context="Our products are made from bamboo and recycled materials. The target audience is environmentally conscious millennials.",
    temperature=0.7,  # Controls AI creativity (0.0-1.0)
    total_length=30   # Target video length in seconds
)
```

**Practical Tip**: Be specific in your prompt. Include desired tone, style, key messages, and any must-have elements. The more detailed your prompt, the better the results.

#### 5. Create Storyboard
Generate a scene-by-scene plan for your video:

```python
# Start storyboard generation
storyboard_job = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    deepthink=True,      # Enable for better quality
    overdrive=False,     # Enable for maximum quality (takes longer)
    web_search=True,     # Enable for up-to-date information
    eco=False,           # Set to True for faster results (lower quality)
    iterations=3,        # More iterations = better quality
    full_length=30       # Target video length in seconds
)

# Wait for storyboard to complete
storyboard = client.storyboard.wait_for_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=300
)

print(f"Storyboard created with {len(storyboard['scenes'])} scenes")

# Review and optionally edit specific scenes
scene_index = 2  # Third scene (zero-indexed)
client.storyboard.update_scene(
    storyboard_id=storyboard["storyboard_id"],
    scene_index=scene_index,
    visual_description="Close-up of product with eco-friendly packaging, highlighting the bamboo material with soft natural lighting",
    voiceover_text="Our innovative design eliminates plastic waste while maintaining durability and functionality."
)
```

**Practical Tip**: Review your storyboard carefully. This is the blueprint for your video, and changes here are easier than later in the process.

#### 6. Create Voiceover
Generate narration for your video:

```python
# Create AI-generated voiceover based on your storyboard
voiceover_job = client.voiceover.create_voiceover(
    project_id=project_id,
    voice_id="en-US-Neural2-F"  # Choose a specific voice (optional)
)

# Wait for voiceover to complete
voiceover = client.voiceover.wait_for_voiceover(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=180
)

# Alternatively, upload your own custom voiceover
custom_voiceover_file = client.storage.upload_file(
    file_path="./custom_voiceover.wav",
    folder_path="/voiceovers"
)
client.project.add_voiceover(
    project_id=project_id,
    file_id=custom_voiceover_file["file"]["file_id"]
)
```

**Practical Tip**: For professional videos, consider recording your own voiceover or hiring a voice actor. For quick prototyping, the AI voices work well.

#### 7. Create Sequence
Arrange your media assets into a cohesive timeline:

```python
# Generate the video sequence
sequence_job = client.sequence.create_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    apply_template=True,    # Apply professional video templates
    apply_grade=True,       # Apply color grading for cinematic look
    grade_type="single",    # "single" or "multi" for different looks per scene
    deepthink=True,         # Enable for better quality
    iterations=3            # More iterations = better quality
)

# Wait for sequence to complete
sequence = client.sequence.wait_for_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=600
)
```

**Practical Tip**: Templates add professional transitions, animations, and timing. Enable `apply_template` for polished results.

#### 8. Render Video
Generate the final video output:

```python
# Start the rendering process
render_job = client.render.create_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    target_width=1920,         # Video width in pixels
    target_height=1080,        # Video height in pixels
    bg_music_volume=0.5,       # Background music volume (0.0-1.0)
    video_audio_volume=0.0,    # Original video audio volume (0.0 = mute)
    voiceover_volume=0.5,      # Narration volume (0.0-1.0)
    subtitle_enabled=True,     # Add subtitles for accessibility
    outro_duration=5.0,        # Duration of end card in seconds
    company_name="Eco Solutions Inc.",
    call_to_action="Visit eco-solutions.com today"
)

# Wait for rendering to complete and get download links
render = client.render.wait_for_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=1800
)

# Get streamable and download links
download_info = client.render.get_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    generate_download_link=True,
    generate_streamable_link=True
)

print(f"Video ready! Download URL: {download_info['download_url']}")
print(f"Stream URL: {download_info['streamable_url']}")
```

**Practical Tip**: Enable subtitles for accessibility and for viewers watching with sound off. Add a clear call-to-action at the end of your video.

### Complete End-to-End Script

For a quick implementation of the entire workflow, here's a complete script that follows the flowchart:

```python
from storylinez import StorylinezClient
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import time

# Setup
load_dotenv()
client = StorylinezClient()

# 1-2. Create a new project
project = client.project.create_project(
    name="Product Introduction",
    orientation="landscape",
    purpose="Introduce our sustainable product line"
)
project_id = project["project"]["project_id"]

# 3. Find and add stock media
search_query_results = client.prompt.start_query_gen_and_wait(
    project_id=project_id,
    num_videos=3,
    num_audio=2
)

# Search for videos
video_queries = search_query_results["result"]["results"]["videos"]
stock_videos = client.stock.search(
    queries=video_queries,
    collections=["videos"],
    detailed=True,
    generate_thumbnail=True,
    num_results_videos=3,
    orientation="landscape"
)

# Add videos to project
for video in stock_videos["videos"]:
    client.project.add_stock_file(
        project_id=project_id,
        stock_id=video["stock_id"],
        media_type="videos"
    )
    time.sleep(1)  # Avoid rate limits

# 4. Create a text prompt
client.prompt.create_text_prompt(
    project_id=project_id,
    main_prompt="Create a 30-second video introducing our eco-friendly product line that reduces plastic waste by 75%",
    document_context="Our products are made from bamboo and recycled materials. The target audience is environmentally conscious millennials.",
    temperature=0.7,
    total_length=30
)

# 5. Generate a storyboard
storyboard_job = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    deepthink=True,
    web_search=True
)
storyboard = client.storyboard.wait_for_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=300
)
print(f"Storyboard created with {len(storyboard['scenes'])} scenes")

# 6. Create a voiceover
voiceover_job = client.voiceover.create_voiceover(project_id=project_id)
voiceover = client.voiceover.wait_for_voiceover(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=180
)

# 7. Create a sequence
sequence_job = client.sequence.create_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    apply_template=True,
    apply_grade=True
)
sequence = client.sequence.wait_for_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=600
)

# 8. Render the final video
render_job = client.render.create_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    target_width=1920,
    target_height=1080,
    subtitle_enabled=True,
    company_name="Eco Solutions Inc.",
    call_to_action="Visit eco-solutions.com today"
)
render = client.render.wait_for_render(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=1800
)

# Get the download links
if render["status"] == "COMPLETED":
    download_info = client.render.get_render(
        project_id=project_id,
        generate_download_link=True,
        generate_streamable_link=True
    )
    print(f"Video ready! Download URL: {download_info['download_url']}")
    print(f"Stream URL: {download_info['streamable_url']}")
```

### Troubleshooting Common Workflow Issues

- **Storyboard generating low-quality results**: Increase iterations, enable deepthink and overdrive, and provide more detailed prompts
- **Media not appearing in sequence**: Check that media files were successfully added to the project and are compatible
- **Voiceover sounds unnatural**: Try adjusting the script for more conversational language, or upload a custom voiceover
- **Render taking too long**: Lower the resolution or disable subtitles for faster rendering
- **Stock content doesn't match needs**: Use more specific search terms, lower similarity threshold, or upload custom content

For more detailed video creation options, see the examples directory and module reference documentation.

### Storyboard Creation and Editing

```python
# Create a storyboard with AI assistance
storyboard = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(
    project_id=project_id,
    deepthink=True,
    web_search=True,
    overdrive=True
)

# Wait for storyboard completion
completed_storyboard = client.storyboard.wait_for_storyboard(

    scene_updates=updates
)

# Export storyboard to PDF
pdf_result = client.storyboard.export_to_pdf(
    storyboard_id=completed_storyboard["storyboard_id"],
    include_script=True,
    include_thumbnails=True
)
pdf_url = pdf_result["download_url"]
```

### Brand Management and Styling

```python
# Upload a logo and create a brand preset
brand = client.brand.upload_logo(
    file_path="./company_logo.png",
    name="Corporate Blue",
    is_default=True,
    # Styling options
    outro_bg_color="#003366",
    main_text_color="#FFFFFF",
    sub_text_color="#E0E0E0",

    subtitle_color="#FFFFFF",
    subtitle_bg_color="#000000",
    subtitle_bg_opacity=0.7,
    subtitle_bg_rounded=True
)

# Update company details
company = client.company_details.create(
    company_name="EcoTech Solutions",
    tag_line="Innovating for a Sustainable Future",
    description="""EcoTech Solutions develops eco-friendly technologies 
                  that help businesses reduce their environmental impact 
                  while maintaining productivity.""",
    website="https://ecotechsolutions.example.com",
    industry="Environmental Technology",
    is_default=True
)

# Apply brand to project
client.project.update_project(
    project_id=project_id,
    brand_id=brand["brand_id"],
    company_details_id=company["company_details_id"]
)
```

### Advanced Sequence Operations

```python
# Create a sequence with detailed settings
sequence = client.sequence.create_sequence(
    project_id=project_id,
    apply_template=True,
    apply_grade=True,
    grade_type="multi",  # Enhanced color grading
    orientation="landscape",
    deepthink=True,
    overdrive=True,
    temperature=0.6,
    iterations=2
)

# Update sequence after storyboard changes
client.sequence.update_sequence(
    sequence_id=sequence["sequence_id"],
    update_ai_params=True
)

# Wait for sequence to be ready
completed_sequence = client.sequence.wait_for_sequence(
    sequence_id=sequence["sequence_id"],
    timeout_seconds=600
)

# Get media assets used in the sequence
media = client.sequence.get_sequence_media(
    sequence_id=sequence["sequence_id"],
    include_analysis=True,
    generate_thumbnail=True,
    generate_streamable=True
)

# Track history of sequence changes
history = client.sequence.get_sequence_history(
    sequence_id=sequence["sequence_id"],
    history_type="generation",
    include_current=True
)
```

### AI-Powered Tools

```python
# Generate a creative brief
brief = client.tools.create_creative_brief(
    name="Q4 Campaign Brief",
    user_input="Create a creative brief for our winter product line focusing on indoor comfort and wellness",
    company_details_id=company["company_details_id"],
    deepthink=True,
    overdrive=True,
    web_search=True
)

# Generate audience research
audience = client.tools.create_audience_research(
    name="Home Wellness Audience",
    user_input="Research the audience for premium home wellness products",
    additional_context="Focus on demographics, behaviors, and purchasing patterns of health-conscious homeowners",
    deepthink=True
)

# Create a video plan

    scene_details="Modern living room setting, morning light through windows, focus on product operation and air quality indicator",
    visual_style="Clean, bright, minimalist aesthetic with soft natural lighting"
)
```

## Workflow Patterns

Storylinez SDK supports several workflow patterns to fit different use cases:

### Asynchronous Processing with Polling

For long-running operations:

```python
# Start the job
job = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(project_id=project_id)
job_id = job["job_id"]

# Poll for completion
while True:
    status = client.storyboard.get_storyboard(project_id=project_id)
    if status["status"] in ["COMPLETED", "ERROR"]:
        break
    print(f"Status: {status['status']}, progress: {status.get('progress', '?')}%")
    time.sleep(10)
```

### Helper Methods for Waiting

For convenience, many modules offer wait methods:

```python
# Create and wait in one call
storyboard = client.storyboard.create_and_wait(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout_seconds=300,
    polling_interval=5
)

# Or use the standalone wait method
render = client.render.wait_for_render(
    render_id=render_id,
    timeout_seconds=1200
)
```

### Batch Operations

For processing multiple items:

```python
# Process a batch of videos
video_paths = ["./video1.mp4", "./video2.mp4", "./video3.mp4"]
upload_results = client.storage.batch_upload_files(
    file_paths=video_paths,
    folder_path="/batch_uploads",
    analyze_video=True
)

# Create projects from templates
project_templates = [
    {"name": "Product Demo 1", "orientation": "landscape"},
    {"name": "Product Demo 2", "orientation": "portrait"},
    {"name": "Tutorial Video", "orientation": "landscape"}
]

projects = []
for template in project_templates:
    project = client.project.create_project(**template)
    projects.append(project)
```

### Template-Based Production

For consistent video production:

```python
def create_product_video(product_name, description, features, image_url):
    """Generate a standardized product video based on template"""
    
    # Create project
    project = client.project.create_project(
        name=f"{product_name} Video",
        orientation="landscape"
    )
    project_id = project["project"]["project_id"]
    
    # Create prompt with standardized format
    prompt_text = f"""
    Create a 30-second product video for {product_name}.
    
    Product description:
    {description}
    
    Key features to highlight:
    {", ".join(features)}
    
    Use a professional, modern style with bold typography.
    Include product shots, feature demonstrations, and end with a call to action.
    """
    
    client.prompt.create_text_prompt(
        project_id=project_id,
        main_prompt=prompt_text
    )
    
    # Upload product image if provided
    if image_url:
        # Download and upload image (simplified example)
        import requests
        from io import BytesIO
        
        response = requests.get(image_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            image_data = BytesIO(response.content)
            client.storage.upload_file_object(
                file_object=image_data,
                filename=f"{product_name}.jpg",
                folder_path="/product_images",
                project_id=project_id
            )
    
    # Generate storyboard and wait for completion
    storyboard = client.storyboard.create_and_wait(
        project_id=project_id,
        timeout_seconds=300
    )
    
    # Apply standard brand
    default_brand = client.brand.get_default()
    client.project.update_project(
        project_id=project_id,
        brand_id=default_brand["brand_id"]
    )
    
    # Create sequence and render
    sequence = client.sequence.create_and_wait(
        project_id=project_id,
        apply_template=True,
        apply_grade=True
    )
    
    render = client.render.create_and_wait(
        project_id=project_id,
        target_width=1920,
        target_height=1080,
        subtitle_enabled=True,
        call_to_action="Visit our website to learn more"
    )
    
    # Return completed video info
    return {
        "project_id": project_id,
        "render_id": render["render_id"],
        "download_url": client.render.get_render(
            render_id=render["render_id"], 
            generate_download_link=True
        ).get("download_url")
    }

# Use the template function
new_product_video = create_product_video(
    product_name="EcoWash 3000",
    description="Revolutionary washing machine that uses 50% less water and energy",
    features=["Eco-Mode", "Smart Detection", "Ultra Capacity", "Whisper Quiet"],
    image_url="https://example.com/images/ecowash3000.jpg"
)
```

## Error Handling & Best Practices

### Validation and Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive validation and clear error messages:

```python
try:
    # Invalid parameter (temperature must be 0.0-1.0)
    client.storyboard.create_storyboard(
        project_id=project_id,
        temperature=2.0
    )
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {str(e)}")
    # Output: "Validation error: temperature must be between 0.0 and 1.0"
    
try:
    # Network or API errors
    result = client.project.get_project(project_id="invalid_id")
except requests.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Network error: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"API error: {str(e)}")
```

### Handling Long-Running Jobs

For operations that may take time:

```python
def create_with_timeout(project_id, max_attempts=12, check_interval=10):
    """Create a storyboard with timeout handling"""
    try:
        # Start the storyboard creation
        job = client.storyboard.create_storyboard(project_id=project_id)
        job_id = job["job_id"]
        
        # Poll for completion with timeout
        attempts = 0
        while attempts < max_attempts:
            status = client.storyboard.get_storyboard(project_id=project_id)
            
            if status["status"] == "COMPLETED":
                return status
            
            if status["status"] == "ERROR":
                error_msg = status.get("error_message", "Unknown error")
                raise Exception(f"Storyboard creation failed: {error_msg}")
                
            print(f"Status: {status['status']}, attempt {attempts+1}/{max_attempts}")
            attempts += 1
            time.sleep(check_interval)
            
        # Timeout reached
        raise TimeoutError(f"Operation timed out after {max_attempts * check_interval} seconds")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

### Resource Management

Best practices for managing SDK resources:

```python
# Organizing content with folders
uploads_folder = client.storage.create_folder(
    folder_path="/projects/campaign_2023/uploads"
)

# Cleaning up temporary resources
tmp_files = client.storage.list_files(
    folder_path="/tmp",
    created_before=(datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).isoformat()
)

for file in tmp_files["files"]:
    client.storage.delete_file(file_id=file["file_id"])

# Setting sensible timeouts for operations
try:
    result = client.storyboard.create_and_wait(
        project_id=project_id,
        timeout_seconds=300  # 5 minutes max
    )
except TimeoutError:
    print("Operation is taking longer than expected. Check status later.")
```

## Environment Configuration

The SDK can be configured through environment variables or direct initialization:

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `STORYLINEZ_API_KEY` | API key for authentication | Yes | None |
| `STORYLINEZ_API_SECRET` | API secret for authentication | Yes | None |
| `STORYLINEZ_ORG_ID` | Organization ID | No | None |
| `STORYLINEZ_BASE_URL` | Custom API endpoint | No | `https://api.storylinez.com` |
| `STORYLINEZ_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging | No | `False` |
| `STORYLINEZ_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout in seconds | No | `120` |
| `STORYLINEZ_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retry attempts for failed requests | No | `3` |

### Configuration File

You can also create a config file (`~/.storylinez/config.json`):

```json
{
  "api_key": "api_your_key_here",
  "api_secret": "your_secret_here",
  "org_id": "your_org_id_here",
  "base_url": "https://api.storylinez.com",
  "debug": false,
  "timeout": 120,
  "max_retries": 3
}
```

Load this configuration with:

```python
client = StorylinezClient.from_config()
```

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limits

The Storylinez API applies rate limits based on your subscription plan:

- Free tier: 60 requests per minute
- Pro tier: 300 requests per minute
- Enterprise: Custom limits

The SDK includes built-in rate limiting and automatic retry logic to handle rate limit errors.

### Batch Operations

For bulk processing, use batch operations when available:

```python
# Better than uploading files in a loop
results = client.storage.batch_upload_files(
    file_paths=[file1, file2, file3],
    folder_path="/batch_uploads"
)

# Better than individual requests
files = client.storage.get_files_by_ids(
    file_ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"]
)
```

### Asynchronous Processing

For high-throughput applications, consider asynchronous patterns:

```python
import asyncio
import concurrent.futures

async def process_projects(project_ids):
    # Use a thread pool for concurrent API calls
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        futures = [
            loop.run_in_executor(
                executor,
                lambda id=pid: client.project.get_project(project_id=id)
            )
            for pid in project_ids
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*futures)
        return results

# Use the async function
project_ids = ["id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"]
results = asyncio.run(process_projects(project_ids))
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Authentication failed | Invalid API key | Verify API key and secret are correct |
| Permission denied | Missing role/scope | Check permissions in Storylinez dashboard |
| Rate limit exceeded | Too many requests | Add backoff logic or request rate limit increase |
| Timeout errors | Operation taking too long | Increase timeout value or use asynchronous patterns |
| Resource not found | Incorrect ID or deleted resource | Verify IDs and check if resource exists |

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed request/response information:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger('storylinez')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create client with debug enabled
client = StorylinezClient(
    api_key="your_key",
    api_secret="your_secret",
    debug=True
)
```

### Checking API Health

Check API service status:

```python
status = client.utils.service_status()
print(f"API Status: {status['status']}")
print(f"API Version: {status['version']}")
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Custom Workflows with Operation Chaining

You can chain operations to create custom workflows:

```python
def create_highlight_reel(client, video_files, title, duration=60):
    """Create a highlight reel from multiple video files"""
    # Create project
    project = client.project.create_project(
        name=f"Highlight Reel: {title}",
        orientation="landscape",
        purpose=f"Create a {duration}-second highlight reel"
    )
    project_id = project["project"]["project_id"]
    
    # Upload and analyze videos
    for file_path in video_files:
        video = client.storage.upload_file(
            file_path=file_path,
            analyze_video=True,
            generate_chapters=True
        )
        # Add video to project
        client.project.add_associated_file(
            project_id=project_id,
            file_id=video["file"]["file_id"]
        )
        
    # Create an AI-driven prompt based on uploads
    client.prompt.create_text_prompt(
        project_id=project_id,
        main_prompt=f"Create a {duration}-second highlight reel from the uploaded videos. Focus on exciting moments, set to upbeat music.",
        total_length=duration,
        deepthink=True
    )
    
    # Process end-to-end
    storyboard = client.storyboard.create_and_wait(project_id=project_id)
    sequence = client.sequence.create_and_wait(project_id=project_id, apply_template=True)
    render = client.render.create_and_wait(project_id=project_id)
    
    return render
```

### Implementing Custom Retry Logic

For robust production applications:

```python
def execute_with_retry(func, max_retries=5, initial_backoff=1, max_backoff=60):
    """Execute a function with exponential backoff retry logic"""
    retry_count = 0
    backoff = initial_backoff

### Event-Driven Processing with Webhooks

For integrating with other services:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook/render/complete', methods=['POST'])
def render_complete_handler():
    data = request.json
    render_id = data.get('render_id')
    project_id = data.get('project_id')
    status = data.get('status')
    
    if status == 'COMPLETED':
        # Get the rendered video
        render_info = client.render.get_render(
            render_id=render_id,
            generate_download_link=True
        )
        
        # Store the download URL
        download_url = render_info.get('download_url')
        
        # Notify users or trigger further processes
        notify_completion(project_id, download_url)
        
    return {'status': 'success'}

def notify_completion(project_id, download_url):
    # Send email, push notification, etc.
    pass
```

### Staying Updated
