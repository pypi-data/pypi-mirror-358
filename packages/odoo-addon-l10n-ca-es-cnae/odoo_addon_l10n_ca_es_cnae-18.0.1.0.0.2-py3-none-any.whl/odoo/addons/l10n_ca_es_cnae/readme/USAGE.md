To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to **Contacts \> Configuration \> Import NACE Industries**.
2. Run the wizard. If ca_ES is available, industry names will be updated with their Catalan translations.
3. To verify, go to **Contacts \> Configuration \> Industries** with a user whose language is set to Catalan.

You can safely run the wizard multiple times. Translations will update existing records â€” no duplicates. Industries are assigned using specific fields on the **company** partner form, like Main industry or Secondary industries.
