# Python Library

The conda library serves several purposes:

* Execute [Specific operations](./liberrpa) for RPA projects—only this section will be published to conda-forgeunder the name "liberrpa".
* [Initialize](./exe/InitLiberRPA) LiberRPA on computers that do not have it installed.
* Communicate with [the Chrome extension](./exe/ChromeGetLocalServerPort) to pass WebSocket initialization information.
* Create [a local Flask server](./exe/LiberRPALocalServer) to accomplish tasks that are difficult to achieve in a standalone Python project.

# Global Objects

LiberRPA creates a global object to store project-related information.

You can view its implementation in [ProjectFlowInit.py](https://github.com/HUHARED/LiberRPA/condaLibrary/FlowControl/ProjectFlowInit.py).

```python
class ProjectArguments:
    """
    A class to handle project arguments, initialization from the 'project.flow' file,
    and track elapsed time since object creation.

    Attributes:
        projectPath (str): The path of the current working directory.
        projectName (str): The name of the project (based on the directory name).
        errorObj (Exception | None): An exception object, or None if no errors occurred.
        customArgs (dict[str, Any]): A dictionary to store the custom project arguments.
        elapsedTime (float): The time elapsed since the program started (in seconds).
    """
...
PrjArgs = ProjectArguments()
CustomArgs: dict[str, Any] = PrjArgs.customArgs
```

In your RPA project, you can use the two global objects—`PrjArgs` and `CustomArgs`—as shown in the example below:

```python
print(PrjArgs)
print(PrjArgs.elapsedTime)
print(PrjArgs.customArgs)
print(PrjArgs.errorObj)
print(PrjArgs.projectPath)
print(CustomArgs)
```

These global objects provide a convenient way to access and manage key project data throughout your LiberRPA project.

## OCR

### get_text_with_position

Perform OCR on an image and returns text blocks with their positions.
Note that it bases on EasyOCR, calculate by CPU in local machine, so the handle time will increase significantly with image's size.
The first run will take some time to initialize.

min_size, low_text, mag_ratio,add_margin are most useful generally.
If you don't know the arguments' meaning, refer to [EasyOCR api](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/documentation/)

The default model "english_default" is actually "english_g2" of EasyOCR. You can add your custom model into the path 'LiberRPA/envs/ocr', put the .pth file in 'model', the .yaml and .py file in '/model/CustomModel', then add the information into 'ocr.jsonc'. Restart LiberRPA Local Server, it will load the model automatically.

Parameters:

```
image: Path to the image file.
modelName: The model used for OCR.
min_size: Minimum text size (in pixel) to detect. Increase it may help to detect more text.
low_text: Text low-bound score. Increase it may help to detect more text.
mag_ratio: Image magnification ratio. Increase it may help to detect more text.
add_margin: Additional margin to add around text during detection. Increase it may help to detect more characters at the beginning and end of the text block.
decoder: Options are 'greedy', 'beamsearch' and 'wordbeamsearch'.
beamWidth: How many beam to keep when decoder = 'beamsearch' or 'wordbeamsearch'
contrast_ths: Text box with contrast lower than this value will be passed into model 2 times. First is with original image and second with contrast adjusted to 'adjust_contrast' value. The one with more confident level will be returned as a result.
adjust_contrast: Target contrast level for low contrast text box
filter_ths: Filter threshold.
text_threshold: Text confidence threshold.
link_threshold: Link confidence threshold.
canvas_size: Maximum image size. Image bigger than this value will be resized down.
slope_ths: Maximum slope (delta y/delta x) to considered merging. Low value means tiled boxes will not be merged.
ycenter_ths: Maximum shift in y direction. Boxes with different level should not be merged.
height_ths: Maximum different in box height. Boxes with very different text size should not be merged.
width_ths: Maximum horizontal distance to merge boxes.
y_ths: Maximum verticall distance to merge text boxes. (May not work due to paragraph=False in this function)
x_ths: Maximum horizontal distance to merge text boxes.(May not work due to paragraph=False in this function)
threshold: General threshold for detection.

```

Returns:

```
