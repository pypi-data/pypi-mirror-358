# Core Concepts

Understanding the core concepts will help you use the Monsoon Crop Predictor effectively.

## Crops Supported

The package currently supports three major crops:

- **Rice**: Primary monsoon crop, grown across India
- **Wheat**: Rabi crop, affected by winter rainfall
- **Maize**: Grown in both seasons, versatile crop

## Input Features

### Required Features

- **Crop Type**: One of 'rice', 'wheat', or 'maize'
- **Location**: State and district in India
- **Rainfall**: Total rainfall in mm
- **Temperature**: Average temperature in Â°C
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity percentage

### Optional Features

- **Area**: Cultivation area in hectares
- **Irrigation**: Irrigation percentage (0-100)
- **Fertilizer**: Fertilizer usage in kg/hectare
- **Seeds**: Seed variety information

## Prediction Outputs

### Primary Output

- **Yield Prediction**: Expected yield in tonnes per hectare
