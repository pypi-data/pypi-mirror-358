  "body": "And when we pass legislation that we feel reasonably sure is unconstitutional, we're probably violating that oath.\" Yet he still couldn't resist the bill's promise that it was protecting children. \"I think this is important enough to support it and hope for the best,\" Luneau concluded before voting in favor.\n\nA VPN might have saved Elizabeth Henson's date nights, but she didn't just want a technical workaround. She wanted to get rid of the law and was connected to a little-known but powerful lobbying group already gearing up to sue Louisiana.\n\nFounded in the early 1990s, the Free Speech Coalition was originally envisioned as a legal-defense fund for adult companies targeted by prosecutors. In the decades since, it has repeatedly beaten back the anti-porn forces. In 1997, it shut down a proposed California tax on pornography. In 2002, the Supreme Court found in its favor in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, deciding that a definition of \"child pornography\" written into law by Senator Orrin Hatch -- one which did not require media to contain children or even sex in order to be criminalized -- was overly broad. In 2016, the organization's efforts sank California's Proposition 60, a ballot initiative mandating condoms in porn productions filmed in the state.\n\nToday, FSC is led by Alison Boden, a onetime CEO of the fetish site Kink.com. Twenty years ago, Boden entered the adult industry as a wide-eyed sex educator eager to bring a feminist sex shop to her Pittsburgh community. \"My personal background comes from a place of activism, and it ended up in business,\" she said. Under Boden's tenure, FSC began lobbying Congress to outlaw what she says is financial discrimination by banks against the adult industry, such as when Wells Fargo terminated sex-worker bank accounts en masse. But then HB 142 passed, and Boden's days have been filled by pushback against age-verification laws in the form of court challenges against Louisiana, Utah, and Texas, where FSC last month obtained a preliminary injunction against the law taking effect. \"The restriction is constitutionally problematic because it deters adults' access to legal sexually explicit material, far beyond the interest of protecting minors,\" the federal judge said in his ruling, which Texas is expected to appeal.\n\nA diverse group of complainants are fighting back. In addition to Henson, there's D.S. Dawson, a Utah-based erotica writer who uses Pornhub to advertise his stories; John Doe, an attorney who represents members of the sex industry and considers being asked to upload an ID to visit his clients' websites a gross violation of his privacy (a core value that's also behind his decision to be an anonymous plaintiff); and O.School, a sex-education site that fears its willingness to talk about sexual pleasure might lead some states to label it porn. The plaintiffs are united by a basic argument: That by limiting adult access to constitutionally protected and fully legal speech -- which, yes, pornography made by consenting adults counts as -- age-verification laws are an unconstitutional violation of their First Amendment rights. And, as was the case when the Supreme Court found COPA unconstitutional, there are other, far less burdensome ways to prevent young people from accessing porn online that don't violate the rights of adults who wish to consume and distribute legal adult content, such as parental filters.\n\nAnother argument they make is that age verification poses a danger to privacy. \"The Oregon DMV just had a massive security breach,\" said Henson. \"And somehow I'm supposed to trust that that's not going to happen to a third-party app?\" One adult webmaster, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to draw potentially litigious attention to their site, told me that their largely queer and trans user base expressed concern that age-verification information might be used to identify and persecute them in states such as Texas, which has an age-verification law and is cracking down on LGBTQ rights.\n\nAnother has to do with the cost, which can range from 25 cents per ID check (a rate one webmaster said they were given by the age-verification platform Yoti) to 65 cents (what FSC says Allpasstrust charges). In other words, a website getting 1 million visitors per month would spend at least $250,000 verifying their ages. \"The fact that age verification is so expensive to the point where most businesses can't afford to do it as prescribed in the laws means that this is an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech,\" Boden said.\n\nSchlegel has no sympathy. \"The porn industry is a multibillion-dollar, very highly unregulated industry, and that's why you're seeing them getting sued for having child pornography [and] people's rape videos -- they're wholly unregulated,\" she said. \"And they're only responsible when someone makes them responsible.\"\n\nThe porn industry is very highly regulated, through both federal laws and less formal regulation conducted by banks and credit-card processors, but what Schlegel said also masks a deeper issue raised by age-verification laws. To most people, the targets of these laws are obviously the massive multinational porn conglomerates for whom age-verification fees are minor, such as the parent company of Pornhub. But the laws would affect all small, independent sites whose minimal or nonexistent profits can't cover the cost of age-verification services.\n\nThe laws seemingly exempt massive, multibillion-dollar social-media sites where young people can and do encounter porn, such as X (formerly Twitter). The text of HB 142 notes that age-verification law only applies to sites featuring a \"substantial portion\" of objectionable content, defined as more than 33.3 percent of a website's total material. How that is calculated is never made clear, but what is clear is that the provision is a massive exception for social media. Is the porn video a teen finds on an NSFW sub-Reddit less harmful because Reddit is also full of less obscene content? Or are lawmakers simply eager to give a carve-out to massive tech companies whose legal budgets could easily tie up age-verification laws in court?\n\nSchlegel explained her legislation was simply an attempt to create a category that would include as many adult sites as possible to balance adult freedoms with the government's interest in protecting children. \"With this goal in mind, I consulted with lawyers and decided to take a measured approach. I wanted our bill to be narrow in scope and not be overboard,\" she said.\n\nSmaller operations don't always feel protected by that measured stance. Take, for instance, Oh Joy Sex Toy, a sex-education webcomic run by Portland-based couple Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan. At first glance, Oh Joy Sex Toy seems exempt from HB 142's purview. The site is clearly educational in nature. Although Moen and Nolan occasionally run explicitly erotic comics, they say those make up less than a third of their library -- putting Oh Joy Sex toy in compliance with the vague standard set by HB 142. Multiple lawyers have told them they have no cause for concern, according to the couple. And yet Nolan can't shake the anxiety that they might get swept up in an anti-porn crackdown. \"I feel very disarmed by it all. It does mean I have to live in perpetual fear,\" he said. A sex-ed comic book jointly authored by the couple has come under fire from a number of parents across the country who consider the book far too hot for library shelves. There's nothing stopping those same parents from suing Moen and Nolan under HB 142.\n\n\"The larger project is to close off the internet,\" said Stabile. \"It's not a coincidence that this is happening at a time when they are simultaneously declaring all sorts of LGBTQ content, all sorts of content on sex education or race, as pornography or obscene.\" Porn may be the enemy lawmakers are eager to target, but their weapon of choice stands to cause a lot of collateral damage.",
