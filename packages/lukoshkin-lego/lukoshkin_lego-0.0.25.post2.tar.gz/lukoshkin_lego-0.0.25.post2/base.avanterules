Abide to the requirements below when generating code:
1. Prefer the following conventions:
  - at least two letters for variable names (exc instead of e, fd instead of f)
  - Path from pathlib over os.path
  - f-strings over .format() and % formatting
  - loguru's logger over print and logging
  - up-to-date typing hints: dict, list, tuple over Dict, List, Tuple
2. Fit the code into 79 characters per line limitation. It mainly applies to
strings, since the code can be formatted with black. Thus, you should format
the code with black first and then ensure 79 char per line by reformulating
strings.
  simply breaking lines,
3. Avoid deep nesting by:
  - using functions to break down complex logic.
  - re-structuring conditionals
  - using early returns
