  "body": "All Elizabeth Henson wanted last January was to find a hot porn video to share with her husband, who was off in a different city prepping to sell their old house. As the wife of an active-duty coastguardsman, she's often in a long-distance relationship, and porn helps bring them together. \"We use it for date night,\" she said, explaining that the two of them log in to Pornhub while video-chatting each other, pleasuring themselves to the same XXX scene. \"It's no different than both of us logging in to Netflix to watch a movie. It's just more intimate.\"\n\nBut this time she wasn't greeted with Pornhub's typical selection of hard-core previews. Instead, Henson was taken to a brand-new landing page for Louisiana residents such as herself. In order to proceed any further, she was told, she'd have to verify that she was at least 18 years old by entering her Louisiana ID into a third-party platform called Allpasstrust. The blockade was the result of the state's HB 142, a new law mandating age-verification systems for websites that offer users access to \"material harmful to minors.\"\n\nPornhub's landing page assured Henson that the verification process would be quick and easy. It wasn't. In fact, she couldn't use Allpasstrust at all. Although she lives in Louisiana, she remains a Texas resident thanks to a federal law that allows servicemembers and their spouses to maintain legal residency in other states for certain purposes like voting. \"It's not my choice to be in Louisiana,\" she said, noting that changing her residency every time her husband was reassigned would come with a whole slew of financial and tax implications -- ones that aren't worth taking on just to prove to Pornhub that she's 40.\n\nHenson was stopped only temporarily, though. After conferring with military friends, she learned there was an easy workaround: a virtual private network that enabled her to fool Pornhub into thinking she wasn't in Louisiana so she could carry on with her date night as planned. \"It's not like most kids don't know how to use a VPN, so what's the point?\" she asked.\n\nThe point, according to proponents of the Louisiana law -- and its copycats in Utah, Montana, Mississippi, Virginia, Arkansas, and Texas -- is protecting children, full stop. At a time when young people are in the midst of a major mental-health crisis, one that some have attributed to the internet, barricading porn access is presented as an obvious first response to the emergency. It may not be foolproof, but if it prevents porn from warping children's minds, it's worth it. For many, it's no more complicated than that.\n\nWith their focus on cutting-edge identity-verification technology, these laws may seem like a wholly new legal innovation, but they're just the latest battle in the long war on porn, one that has pitted First Amendment freedoms against the desire to shield children from any potential harm -- and revealed, again and again, that \"porn\" is often in the eye of the beholder.\n\nThe spark that ignited the latest attack on porn came from Howard Stern.\n\nIn a December 2021 interview with him, the singer Billie Eilish confessed that she'd begun watching porn at 11, which she blamed for her failed relationships as an adult. When newly elected Louisiana lawmaker Laurie Schlegel read about the interview, it sounded all too familiar from her career working with people addicted to porn as a licensed professional counselor. Still, hearing someone as prominent as Eilish speak so vulnerably about her own sexual and romantic struggles moved her. \"It sent me on a journey to see what other countries are doing,\" said Schlegel, who wrote HB 142.\n\nOver the past two centuries, government hostility to obscenity has ebbed and flowed, peaking during periods of repression, like the era of the Comstock laws or the Reagan years, and recently becoming more laissez-faire. But with the advent of the internet, it seemed as though porn had finally won the upper hand and was practically ungovernable. In the U.S. early attempts at regulating online porn, like the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA), were deemed unconstitutional by courts that found them to be overly broad in their restriction of free speech. Other countries have had slightly more success. In 2017, the United Kingdom mandated age verification for porn sites, though two years later the proposal fell apart over regulatory and technological obstacles. In 2020, Germany moved forward with its own age-verification law, subsequently ordering the country's largest internet service providers to block a major porn site. Canada, Australia, and France have all either considered or passed age-verification laws, and the U.K. is making another attempt.\n\nNone of those countries have American free-speech protections, however. The First Amendment stopped COPA in its tracks, and a German-style age-verification bill would probably be dead on arrival in the U.S. But Schlegel's brainchild isn't a criminal law enforced by the government. Her bill is enforced through civil lawsuits that, crucially, can be filed by anyone who feels a child has been harmed by a website's lax approach toward age verification, mimicking the \"bounty hunting\" enforcement strategy of the six-week abortion ban in Texas.\n\nEver since HB 142 was enacted, both the porn industry and a variety of creators whose work might potentially be considered \"harmful to minors\" have been panicking. \"The chilling effect here is the point,\" said Michael Stabile, the communications director for the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry trade group. Stabile is convinced that the real goal of such age-verification laws is nothing short of shuttering the adult industry. Porn, he told me, is \"an easy bogeyman to go after,\" with few people in power willing to advocate for such a stigmatized art form.\n\nSchlegel, however, believes these laws are a no-brainer. The chances of a child encountering porn are \"100 percent,\" she said, adding that \"the average age is between 10 and 12\" when children are first exposed to porn. Statistics on youth porn consumption can be hard to pin down, but clearly young people are watching porn. Early this year, Common Sense Media -- a nonprofit group known for rating content aimed at kids -- released a research report compiled from a survey of 1,358 young people between the ages of 13 and 17. The study found that 73 percent had watched pornography online and that 54 percent had first seen porn before the age of 13.\n\nHow that exposure affects young people is harder to determine. Researchers can't analyze the effects of porn viewing on young minds as it's both illegal and unethical to show minors porn, even in the name of research. Or as Common Sense put it, there \"has been little research on the effects of pornography on adolescents, and so we should remain alert to alarmist headlines about pornography being a public health crisis or destroying America's youth.\" The research that does exist on porn and adolescents is hardly conclusive: Consumption can increase sexual aggression, anxiety, and depression, but it can also improve body acceptance and knowledge of sex and anatomy -- particularly for LGBTQ youth, for whom porn is often the only source of queer-inclusive representations of sexuality.\n\nIn the absence of clear answers, there are deep divides about how to protect children -- and, perhaps more thornily, what \"protecting\" them would even mean. The adult industry's preferred approach is a combination of content filters that allow parents to block their child's access to porn and comprehensive sex education in schools. But in state capitols, on both sides of the aisle, the answer is straightforward: age verification. It's offered up as a common-sense fix: If you have to show an ID to buy beer, why not porn?\n\nThe bills appear unstoppable in their popularity. Tellingly, even legislators with reservations seem leery about opposing them. When Schlegel's colleague Senator W. Jay Luneau weighed in on HB 142, he said he was told \"unequivocally\" by a constitutional lawyer \"that your bill is clearly unconstitutional. When I was sworn in as a senator, I raised my right hand to God and took an oath to uphold the Constitution.",
