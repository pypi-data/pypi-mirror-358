    "# QEP Regression with LOVE for Fast Predictive Variances and Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate that LOVE (the method for fast variances and sampling introduced in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06058) can significantly reduce the cost of computing predictive distributions. This can be especially useful in settings like small-scale Bayesian optimization, where predictions need to be made at enormous numbers of candidate points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will train a KISS-QEP model on the `skillcraft `UCI dataset, and then compare the time required to make predictions with each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The timing results reported in the paper compare the time required to compute (co)variances __only__. Because excluding the mean computations from the timing results requires hacking the internals of QPyTorch, the timing results presented in this notebook include the time required to compute predictive means, which are not accelerated by LOVE. Nevertheless, as we will see, LOVE achieves impressive speed-ups."
