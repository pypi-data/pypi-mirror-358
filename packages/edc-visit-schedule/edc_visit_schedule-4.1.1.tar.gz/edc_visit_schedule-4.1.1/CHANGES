Changes
=======

4.0.2
-----
- remove Onschedule model post-save signal. The signal was calling put_onschedule.
  This was a redundant call since it was put_onschedule() that created
  the OnSchedule model instance in the first place.
- Remove `resave` method on Schedule and SubjectSchedule. Replace with
  Schedule.refresh_schedule which wraps SubjectSchedule.refresh_appointments.
  SubjectSchedule.refresh_appointments now explicitly calls create_appointments.
  That was the original intention of the now removed post_save signal.
- add a manager method to OnSchedule to call put_onschedule (mostly for
  tests)..

0.3.18
------
- add methods to `schedule` to list visits where CRFs and requisitions are required

0.3.7
-----
- requisition can now accept both panel and panel group
- add some utils to check if baseline

0.2.19
------
- pass visit_schedule_name and schedule name to ``take_off_schedule`` when
  calling appointment manager method to delete future appts
