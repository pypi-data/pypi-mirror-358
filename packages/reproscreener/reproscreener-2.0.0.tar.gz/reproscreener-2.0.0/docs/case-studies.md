# Case studies

1. `mine50` contains the 50 most recent articles from [arxiv.org in both the cs.LG and stat.ML categories](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent), between the dates 2022-10-24 and 2022-10-25 and contained 570 search results at the time of the dataset creation. The search result is sorted by date in descending order

    !!! note
        The date being queried for is the last updated date and not the date of paper submission

2. `mine50-csLG` contains the results using the same method as `mine50` but without looking for articles in both cs.LG and stat.ML.
