# FP-Devicer
## Developed by Gateway Corporate Solutions LLC

FP-Devicer is a digital fingerprinting middleware library designed for ease of use and near-universal compatibility with servers.

Importing and using the library to compare fingerprints between users is as simple as collecting some user data and running the calculateConfidence function.
```python
from devicer.confidence import calculate_confidence

user1, user2 = {
  """Collected data goes here"""
}

const confidence = calculate_confidence(user1, user2)
```

The resulting confidence will range between 0 and 100, with 100 providing the highest confidence of the users being identical.
