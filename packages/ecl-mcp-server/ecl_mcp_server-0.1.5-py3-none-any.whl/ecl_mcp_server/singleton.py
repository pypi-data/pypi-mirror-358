class SingletonBase(type):
    """Base class for singleton pattern, ensures only one instance per subclass

    Implements singleton pattern by overriding __new__ method. All subclasses will share
    the same instance. Uses class-level _instances dictionary to store instances of each
    singleton class.

    Example:
        >>> class MySingleton(SingletonBase):
        ...     pass
        >>> a = MySingleton()
        >>> b = MySingleton()
        >>> a is b
        True
    """

            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]
