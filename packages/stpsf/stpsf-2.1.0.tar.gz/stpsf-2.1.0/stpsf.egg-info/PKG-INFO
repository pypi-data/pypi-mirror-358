**STPSF HAS BEEN MIGRATED FROM WEBBPSF**

STPSF produces simulated PSFs for the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's
flagship infrared space telescope. STPSF can simulate images for any of the
four science instruments plus the fine guidance sensor, including both direct
imaging, coronagraphic, and spectroscopic modes.

STPSF also supports simulating PSFs for the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST),
including its Wide Field Instrument and a preliminary version of the Coronagraph Instrument.

.. note::

   The current (Cycle 10) Roman WFI optical model was calculated by Goddard
   Space Flight Center in September 2024.

Documentation can be found online at https://stpsf.readthedocs.io

STPSF requires input data for its simulations, including optical path
difference (OPD) maps, filter transmission curves, and coronagraph Lyot mask
shapes. These data files are not included in this source distribution.
Please see the documentation to download the required data files.
