class Importer:
    """
    Base class for all data importers / exporters.

    So as with :class:`~wuttasync.importing.handlers.ImportHandler`,
    despite the name ``Importer`` this class can be used for export as
    well.  Occasionally it's helpful to know "which mode" is in
    effect, mostly for display to the user.  See also
    :attr:`orientation` and :attr:`actioning`.

    The role of the "importer/exporter" (instance of this class) is to
    process the import/export of data for **one "model"** - which
    generally speaking, means one table.  Whereas the "import/export
    handler" (:class:`~wuttasync.importing.handlers.ImportHandler`
    instance) orchestrates the overall DB connections, transactions
    and invokes the importer(s)/exporter(s).  So multiple
    importers/exporters may run in the context of a single handler
    job.

    .. attribute:: handler

       Reference to the parent
       :class:`~wuttasync.importing.handlers.ImportHandler` instance.

    .. attribute:: model_class

       Reference to the :term:`data model` class representing the
       target side, if applicable.

       This normally would be a SQLAlchemy mapped class, e.g.
       :class:`~wuttjamaican:wuttjamaican.db.model.base.Person` for
       importing to the Wutta People table.

       It is primarily (only?) used when the target side of the
       import/export uses SQLAlchemy ORM.

    .. attribute:: fields

       This is the official list of "effective" fields to be processed
       for the current import/export job.

       Code theoretically should not access this directly but instead
       call :meth:`get_fields()`.  However it is often convenient to
       overwrite this attribute directly, for dynamic fields.  If so
       then ``get_fields()`` will return the new value.  And really,
       it's probably just as safe to read this attribute directly too.

    .. attribute:: excluded_fields

       This attribute will often not exist, but is mentioned here for
       reference.

       It may be specified via constructor param in which case each
       field listed therein will be removed from :attr:`fields`.

    Base class for importer/exporter using input file as data source.

    Depending on the subclass, it may be able to "guess" (at least
    partially) the path to the input file.  If not, and/or to avoid
    ambiguity, the caller must specify the file path.

    In most cases caller may specify any of these via kwarg to the
    class constructor, or e.g.
    :meth:`~wuttasync.importing.handlers.ImportHandler.process_data()`:

    * :attr:`input_file_path`
    * :attr:`input_file_dir`
    * :attr:`input_file_name`

    The subclass itself can also specify via override of these
    methods:

    * :meth:`get_input_file_path()`
    * :meth:`get_input_file_dir()`
    * :meth:`get_input_file_name()`

    And of course subclass must override these too:

    * :meth:`open_input_file()`
    * :meth:`close_input_file()`
    * (and see also :attr:`input_file`)

    .. attribute:: input_file_path

       Path to the input file.

    .. attribute:: input_file_dir

       Path to folder containing input file(s).

    .. attribute:: input_file_name

       Name of the input file, sans folder path.

    .. attribute:: input_file

       Handle to the open input file, if applicable.  May be set by
       :meth:`open_input_file()` for later reference within
       :meth:`close_input_file()`.
