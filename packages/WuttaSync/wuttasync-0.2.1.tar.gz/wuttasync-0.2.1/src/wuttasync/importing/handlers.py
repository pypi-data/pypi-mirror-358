    Base class for all import/export handlers.

    Despite the name ``ImportHandler`` this can be used for export as
    well.  The logic is no different on a technical level and the
    "export" concept is mostly only helpful to the user.  The latter
    is important of course and to help with that we track the
    :attr:`orientation` to distinguish.

    The role of the "import/export handler" (instance of this class)
    is to orchestrate the overall DB connections, transactions and
    then invoke the importer/exporter instance(s) to do the actual
    data assessment/transfer.  Each of the latter will be an instance

    Note that the value may be displayed to the user where helpful::

       print(handler.orientation.value)

    See also :attr:`actioning`.

    It's important to understand the difference between import/export
    and source/target; they are independent concepts.  Source and
    target indicate where data comes from and where it's going,
    whereas import vs. export is mostly cosmetic.

    How a given data flow's orientation is determined, is basically up
    to the developer.  Most of the time it is straightforward,
    e.g. CSV → Wutta would be import, and Wutta → CSV would be
    export.  But confusing edge cases certainly exist, you'll know
    them when you see them.  In those cases the developer should try
    to choose whichever the end user is likely to find less confusing.
