WuttaSync
=========

This package adds data import/export and real-time sync utilities for
the `Wutta Framework <https://wuttaproject.org>`_.

*(NB. the real-time sync has not been added yet.)*

The primary use cases in mind are:

* keep operational data in sync between various business systems
* import data from user-specified file
* export to file

This isn't really meant to replace typical ETL tools; it is smaller
scale and (hopefully) more flexible.

While it of course supports import/export to/from the Wutta :term:`app
database`, it may be used for any "source â†’ target" data flow.
