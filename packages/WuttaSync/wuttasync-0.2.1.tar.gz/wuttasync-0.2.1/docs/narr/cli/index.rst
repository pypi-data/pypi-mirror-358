 Command Line Interface
========================

The primary way of using the import/export framework day to day is via
the command line.

WuttJamaican defines the ``wutta`` :term:`command` and WuttaSync comes
with some extra :term:`subcommands <subcommand>` for importing to /
exporting from the Wutta :term:`app database`.

It is fairly simple to add a dedicated subcommand for any
:term:`import handler`; see below.

And for more general info about CLI see
:doc:`wuttjamaican:narr/cli/index`.
