"""
Exceptions for the DOCX converter module.

This module defines custom exception classes used by the DOCX converter
to handle various error conditions that may occur during document processing.
These exceptions provide more specific error information than generic exceptions,
making it easier to diagnose and handle problems when working with DOCX files.
"""


# Define custom exceptions
class DocxConverterError(Exception):
    """Base exception class for DOCX converter errors."""

    pass


class DocxFormatError(DocxConverterError):
    """Exception raised when the DOCX file format is invalid or corrupted."""

    pass


class DocxXmlError(DocxConverterError):
    """Exception raised when there's an error parsing XML in the DOCX file."""

    pass


class DocxContentError(DocxConverterError):
    """Exception raised when required content is missing from the DOCX file."""
