## What Is chariot-ds

chariot-datasystem is a distributed data caching system that leverages the HBM/DRAM/SSD resources of a compute cluster to build a multi-level cache close to computation, improving data access performance in scenarios such as model training and inference, big data, and microservices.

![logical_architecture](https://gitee.com/jingjinduo/chariot-ds/raw/develop/docs/source_en/getting-started/image/logical_architecture.png "logical_architecture")

chariot-datasystem consists of three components:

- **Multi-language SDK**: It provides Python/C++ language interfaces, encapsulating various semantics such as heterogeneous objects, key-value (KV), and objects, supporting fast data read and write for business implementation.
  - **heterogeneous object**: Based on the NPU card's HBM memory abstraction heterogeneous object interface, it enables high-speed direct data transmission between Ascend NPU cards. It also provides H2D (Host to Device) and D2H (Device to Host) high-speed migration interfaces, facilitating fast data transfer between DRAM and HBM.
  - **KV**: Implements zero-copy Key-Value data read/write via shared memory for high-performance caching, with support for data reliability semantics through external component integration.
  - **object**: Abstracts data objects using host-side shared memory, implements reference-counted lifecycle management, and encapsulates shared memory as buffers with direct pointer-based read/write access.

- **worker**: The core component of chariot-datasystem, responsible for managing DRAM/SSD and metadata while providing near-computing caching capabilities.
  - **Zero-Copy Shared Memory**: Provides data read/write interfaces through shared memory, eliminating data copying between the SDK and worker to enhance performance.
  - **NPU Concurrent Communication**: The heterogeneous object abstraction enables direct inter-NPU communication with automatic HCCL send/receive sequencing, achieving concurrent data transfers across both local NPUs and remote nodes via H2H access.
  - **P2P Data Distribution**: Implements a load-balancing strategy for P2P transfers during large-scale data replication, enabling new data receivers to serve as providers and fully utilizing inter-card link bandwidth.
  - **Metadata Management**: Implements distributed metadata management to achieve linear horizontal scaling and eliminate single-point bottlenecks. Supports metadata reliability for enhanced cluster availability, while providing data publish-subscribe capabilities.
  - **Multi-Level Cache Eviction**: Implements LRU-based cache replacement across tiers, maintaining hot data in memory, warm data on disk, and cold data in secondary cache.
  - **Data Management**: Provides multiple data lifecycle management capabilities including reference counting and TTL. Controls read-write consistency with support for multiple consistency levels. Manages data replicas across nodes, employing multi-copy caching for hot data to improve read efficiency.

- **Cluster Management**: Leverages ETCD to enable node discovery/health monitoring, supporting fault recovery and online scaling (both expansion and contraction).

![Deployment View of chariot-datasystem](https://gitee.com/jingjinduo/chariot-ds/raw/develop/docs/source_en/getting-started/image/deployment.png)
Deployment Architecture of chariot-datasystem (as illustrated in the diagram above):

- The cluster requires **ETCD** deployment for cluster management.
- Each node must deploy a **worker** process registered with ETCD.
- The **SDK** is integrated into user processes and communicates with the local worker.

Data Transmission:
- **SDK ↔ worker**: Shared memory for data read/write.
- **worker ↔ worker**: TCP/RDMA (current version supports TCP only; RDMA support planned).
- **HBM Heterogeneous Objects**: Direct cross-device transmission via HCCS/RoCE.
