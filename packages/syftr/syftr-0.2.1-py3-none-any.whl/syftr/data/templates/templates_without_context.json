(Net) Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)` as proportion of `Total Assets`,\n  e.g., over 25%;\n\n- high `Total Assets` relative to `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`,\n  e.g., over 2 times;\n\n- high `Capital Expenditure(s), a.k.a. CapEx, or Capital Spending, or Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) Expenditure(s)/Purchase(s)`\n  relative to `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`,\n  e.g., over 10%;\n\n  and/or\n\n- low `Return on (Total) Assets, a.k.a. RoA or RoTA`,\n  e.g., under 10%\n\nFINANCIAL-ANALYSIS LANGUAGE/WORDING\n===================================\n\n- When we see the word \"average\" used before a Balance-Sheet line item in financial-analysis contexts,\n  it often means the simple arithmetic mean of that line item's values at two consecutive fiscal year-ends\n\n- When we see the word \"growth\" or the the phrase \"top-line performance\"\n  used in the context of product categories/segments or geographies, unless otherwise specified,\n  it often concerns the year-on-year proportional/relative growth rates in `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`\n  from such product categories/segments or geographies\n\n- When we see the word \"margin\" in financial-analysis contexts,\n  we usually need to divide a certain Profit-and-Loss (P&L) line item by the `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`\n  for the concerned financial reporting period(s)\n\n- When we see the word \"turnover ratio\" used after a Balance-Sheet line item in financial-analysis contexts,\n  we usually need to divide the `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales` for the fiscal year\n  by the average of that Balance-Sheet line item between the latest fiscal year-end and the immediately-preceeding fiscal year-end\n\nPHYSICAL-PRODUCT COMPANY PERFORMANCE METRICS vs. FINANCIAL-SERVICES COMPANY PERFORMANCE METRICS\n===============================================================================================\n\nMargin metrics are generally relevant/useful performance indicators for evaluating companies making physical products,\nbut generally irrelevant / not useful for evaluating companies delivering financial services\n\nPULICLY LISTED & TRADED DEBT SECURITIES\n=======================================\n\nIf there are debt securities registered to trade on a national securities exchange under a company's name,\nthen such debt securities are enumerated on SEC filings' 1st page, alongside the company's public equity shares/stock.\n\nIf only equity shares/stock are enumerated on SEC filings' 1st page,\nthen there are no debt securities registered to trade on a national securities exchange under a company's name. Some examples are given below.\n\nQuestion: {query_str}\nAnswer:\n"
