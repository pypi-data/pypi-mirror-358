## Advanced Features

### Extract Messages from Telegram Archive

You can extract messages from a Telegram export archive (`result.json`) that you've downloaded from Telegram Desktop:

```bash
# Extract all messages from all chats
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json"

# Extract only messages from a specific user (by their Telegram ID)
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json" --user 123456

# Save to a custom output file
telegram-download-chat "/path/to/Telegram Desktop/DataExport/result.json" -o my_exported_chats.json
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Processing your full Telegram data export
- Extracting specific conversations from the export
- Converting the export to a more readable format
- Filtering messages by user or date range (using `--until`)

The tool will process the archive and generate both JSON and TXT files with the exported messages.

### Resuming Interrupted Downloads
If the download is interrupted, you can simply run the same command again to resume from where it left off. The tool automatically saves progress to a temporary file.

### User Mapping
Display names for users and bots are collected automatically. You can override them in the `users_map` section:

```yaml
users_map:
  123456: "Alice Smith"
  789012: "Bob Johnson"
```

### Chat Mapping
Titles for group and channel chats are fetched automatically. Use `chats_map` only if you want to override them:

```yaml
chats_map:
  100123456: "MyGroup"
```

### Subchat Extraction
Extract conversations from specific threads or reply chains:

```bash
# Extract messages from a specific thread
telegram-download-chat group_username --subchat 12345 --subchat-name "Important Discussion"

# Or use a direct message URL
telegram-download-chat group_username --subchat "https://t.me/c/123456789/12345"
```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

For users who prefer a visual interface, the application includes an optional GUI that provides an intuitive way to download Telegram chats.

### Launching the GUI

```bash
# Launch the GUI application
telegram-download-chat --gui
```

### GUI Features

The GUI provides all the functionality of the command-line interface with additional user-friendly features:

#### Main Interface
- **Chat Input**: Enter chat identifier (username, phone number, chat ID, or URL)
- **Output Directory**: Select where to save downloaded files
- **Download Options**: Configure limit, date filters, and other parameters
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar showing download status
- **File List**: View all downloaded files with easy access

#### Advanced Options
- **Message Limit**: Set maximum number of messages to download
- **Date Filter**: Download messages only until a specific date
- **User Filter**: Filter messages by specific sender
- **Subchat Extraction**: Extract messages from specific threads
- **Debug Mode**: Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting

#### Smart Download Management
- **Pause/Resume**: Stop and resume downloads at any time
- **Message Saving**: When you stop a download, all messages that were already fetched are automatically saved
- **Progress Persistence**: Downloads can be resumed from where they left off
- **File Organization**: Downloaded files are automatically organized and displayed

#### Stop and Save Functionality
One of the key GUI features is the ability to stop downloads while preserving progress:

1. **During Download**: Click the "Stop" button to halt the current download
2. **Automatic Saving**: The application will save all messages that were already downloaded
3. **User Feedback**: You'll see a message like "Stopping download and saving messages..."
4. **File Collection**: After stopping, the GUI will display "Messages saved successfully! Found X file(s)."
5. **File Access**: All saved files are immediately available in the file list

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Large chats where you want to preview initial messages
- Testing downloads before committing to full extraction
- Situations where you need to stop due to time constraints
- Recovering partial downloads when issues occur

### GUI vs Command Line

| Feature | GUI | Command Line |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Ease of use | Intuitive interface | Requires command knowledge |
| Progress tracking | Visual progress bar | Text-based progress |
| File management | Integrated file browser | Manual file navigation |

## Output Formats

The tool generates the following files for each chat:

### JSON Output (`[chat_name].json`)
Contains complete message data including metadata like:
- Message IDs and timestamps
- Sender information
- Message content (including formatting)
- Reply information
- Media and file attachments
- Reactions and views

### Text Output (`[chat_name].txt`)
A human-readable version of the chat with:
- Formatted timestamps
- Display names from your `users_map`
- Message content with basic formatting
- Reply indicators

### Example Output Structure

```
2025-05-25 10:30:15 Alice -> MyGroup:
Hello everyone!

2025-05-25 10:31:22 Bob -> MyGroup (replying to Alice):
Hi Alice! How are you?

2025-05-25 10:32:45 Charlie -> MyGroup:
Welcome to the group!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Errors**
   - Ensure your API credentials are correct
   - Try disabling VPN if you're having connection issues
   - Check if your account is not restricted

2. **Missing Messages**
   - Some messages might be deleted or restricted
   - Check if you have the necessary permissions in the chat
   - Try with a smaller limit first

3. **Slow Downloads**
   - The tool respects Telegram's rate limits
   - Increase `request_delay` in config for more reliable downloads
   - Consider using a smaller `limit` parameter
4. **Progress bar**
   - progress show 1000 messages by default
   - when current > 1000, set max to 10000, then 50000, then 100000, etc.
