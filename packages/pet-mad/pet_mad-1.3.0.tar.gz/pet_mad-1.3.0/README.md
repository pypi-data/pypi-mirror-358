## Installation

You can install PET-MAD using pip:

```bash
pip install pet-mad
```

Or directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lab-cosmo/pet-mad.git
```

Alternatively, you can install PET-MAD using `conda` package manager, which is
especially important for running PET-MAD with **LAMMPS**.

> [!WARNING]
> We strongly recommend installing PET-MAD using
> [`Miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) as a base `conda`
> provider, because other `conda` providers (such as `Anaconda`) may yield
> undesired behavior when resolving dependencies and are usually slower than
> `Miniforge`. Smooth installation and use of PET-MAD is not guaranteed with
> other `conda` providers.

To install Miniforge on unix-like systems, run:

```bash
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

Once Miniforge is installed, create a new conda environment and install PET-MAD
with:

```bash
conda create -n pet-mad
conda activate pet-mad
conda install -c metatensor -c conda-forge pet-mad
```

## Pre-trained Models

Currently, we provide the following pre-trained models:

- **`v1.1.0`** or **`latest`**: The updated PET-MAD model with an ability to run
  simulations using the non-conservative forces and stresses (temporarily
  disabled).
- **`v1.0.1`**: The updated PET-MAD model with a new, pure PyTorch backend and
  slightly improved performance.
- **`v1.0.0`**: PET-MAD model trained on the MAD dataset, which contains 95,595
  structures, including 3D and 2D inorganic crystals, surfaces, molecular
  crystals, nanoclusters, and molecules.

## Interfaces for Atomistic Simulations

PET-MAD integrates with the following atomistic simulation engines:

- **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**
- **LAMMPS** (including the KOKKOS support)
- **i-PI**
- **OpenMM** (coming soon)
- **GROMACS** (coming soon)

## Usage

### ASE Interface

You can use the PET-MAD calculator, which is compatible with the Atomic
Simulation Environment (ASE):

```python
from pet_mad.calculator import PETMADCalculator
from ase.build import bulk

atoms = bulk("Si", cubic=True, a=5.43, crystalstructure="diamond")
pet_mad_calculator = PETMADCalculator(version="latest", device="cpu")
atoms.calc = pet_mad_calculator
energy = atoms.get_potential_energy()
forces = atoms.get_forces()
```

These ASE methods are ideal for single-structure evaluations, but they are
inefficient for the evaluation on a large number of pre-defined structures. To
perform efficient evaluation in that case, read [here](docs/README_BATCHED.md).

### Evaluating PET-MAD on a dataset

Efficient evaluation of PET-MAD on a desired dataset is also available from the
command line via [`metatrain`](https://github.com/metatensor/metatrain), which
is installed as a dependency of PET-MAD. To evaluate the model, you first need
to fetch the PET-MAD model from the HuggingFace repository:

```bash
mtt export https://huggingface.co/lab-cosmo/pet-mad/resolve/main/models/pet-mad-latest.ckpt
```

Alternatively, you can also download the model from Python:

```py
import pet_mad

pet_mad.save_pet_mad(version="latest", output="pet-mad-latest.pt")

# you can also get a metatomic AtomisticModel for advance usage
model = pet_mad.get_pet_mad(version="latest")
```

This command will download the model and convert it to TorchScript format. Then
you need to create the `options.yaml` file and specify the dataset you want to
evaluate the model on (where the dataset is stored in `extxyz` format):

```yaml
systems: your-test-dataset.xyz
targets:
  energy:
    key: "energy"
    unit: "eV"
```

Then, you can use the `mtt eval` command to evaluate the model on a dataset:

```bash
mtt eval pet-mad-latest.pt options.yaml --batch-size=16 --extensions-dir=extensions --output=predictions.xyz
```

This will create a file called `predictions.xyz` with the predicted energies and
forces for each structure in the dataset. More details on how to use `metatrain`
can be found in the [Metatrain documentation](https://metatensor.github.io/metatrain/latest/getting-started/usage.html#evaluation).

## Running PET-MAD with LAMMPS

### 1. Install LAMMPS with metatomic support

To use PET-MAD with LAMMPS, you need to first install PET-MAD from `conda` (see
the installation instructions above). Then, follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.metatensor.org/metatomic/latest/engines/lammps.html#how-to-install-the-code) to install lammps-metatomic. We recomend you also use conda to install lammps.

### 2. Run LAMMPS with PET-MAD

#### 2.1. CPU version

Fetch the PET-MAD checkpoint from the HuggingFace repository:

```bash
mtt export https://huggingface.co/lab-cosmo/pet-mad/resolve/main/models/pet-mad-latest.ckpt
```

This will download the model and convert it to TorchScript format compatible
with LAMMPS, using the `metatomic` and `metatrain` libraries, which PET-MAD is
based on.

Prepare a lammps input file using `pair_style metatomic` and defining the
mapping from LAMMPS types in the data file to elements PET-MAD can handle using
`pair_coeff` syntax. Here we indicate that lammps atom type 1 is Silicon (atomic
number 14).

```
units metal
atom_style atomic

read_data silicon.data

pair_style metatomic pet-mad-latest.pt device cpu # Change device to 'cuda' evaluate PET-MAD on GPU
pair_coeff * * 14

neighbor 2.0 bin
timestep 0.001

dump myDump all xyz 10 trajectory.xyz
dump_modify myDump element Si

thermo_style multi
thermo 1

velocity all create 300 87287 mom yes rot yes

fix 1 all nvt temp 300 300 0.10

run 100
```

Create the **`silicon.data`** data file for a silicon system.

```
# LAMMPS data file for Silicon unit cell
8 atoms
1 atom types

0.0  5.43  xlo xhi
0.0  5.43  ylo yhi
0.0  5.43  zlo zhi

Masses

1  28.084999992775295 # Si

Atoms # atomic

1   1   0   0   0
2   1   1.3575   1.3575   1.3575
3   1   0   2.715   2.715
4   1   1.3575   4.0725   4.0725
5   1   2.715   0   2.715
6   1   4.0725   1.3575   4.0725
7   1   2.715   2.715   0
8   1   4.0725   4.0725   1.3575
```

```bash
lmp -in lammps.in  # For serial version
mpirun -np 1 lmp -in lammps.in  # For MPI version
```

#### 2.2. KOKKOS-enabled GPU version

Running LAMMPS with KOKKOS and GPU support is similar to the CPU version, but
you need to change the `lammps.in` slightly and run `lmp` binary with a few
additional flags.

The updated `lammps.in` file looks like this:

```
package kokkos newton on neigh half

units metal
atom_style atomic/kk

read_data silicon.data

pair_style metatensor/kk pet-mad-latest.pt # This will use the same device as the kokkos simulation
pair_coeff * * 14

neighbor 2.0 bin
timestep 0.001

dump myDump all xyz 10 trajectory.xyz
dump_modify myDump element Si

thermo_style multi
thermo 1

velocity all create 300 87287 mom yes rot yes

fix 1 all nvt temp 300 300 0.10

run_style verlet/kk
run 100
```

The **silicon.data** file remains the same.

To run the KOKKOS-enabled version of LAMMPS, you need to run

```bash
lmp -in lammps.in -k on g 1 -sf kk # For serial version
mpirun -np 1 lmp -in lammps.in -k on g 1 -sf kk # For MPI version
```

Here, the `-k on g 1 -sf kk` flags are used to activate the KOKKOS
subroutines. Specifically `g 1` is used to specify, how many GPUs are the
simulation is parallelized over, so if running the large systems on two or more
GPUs, this number should be adjusted accordingly.


### 3. Important Notes

- For **CPU calculations**, use a single MPI task unless simulating large
  systems (30+ Ã… box size). Multi-threading can be enabled via:

  ```bash
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
  ```

- For **GPU calculations**, use **one MPI task per GPU**.

## Running PET-MAD with empirical dispersion corrections

### In **ASE**:

You can combine the PET-MAD calculator with the torch based implementation of
the D3 dispersion correction of `pfnet-research` - `torch-dftd`:

Within the PET-MAD environment you can install `torch-dftd` via:

```bash
pip install torch-dftd
```

Then you can use the `D3Calculator` class to combine the two calculators:

```python
from torch_dftd.torch_dftd3_calculator import TorchDFTD3Calculator
from pet_mad.calculator import PETMADCalculator
from  ase.calculators.mixing import SumCalculator

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

calc_MAD = PETMADCalculator(version="latest", device=device)
dft_d3 = TorchDFTD3Calculator(device=device, xc="pbesol", damping="bj")

combined_calc = SumCalculator([calc_MAD, dft_d3])

# assign the calculator to the atoms object
atoms.calc = combined_calc

```

## Dataset visualization with the PET-MAD featurizer
 
You can use PET-MAD last-layer features together with a pre-trained 
sketch-map dimensionality reduction to obtain 2D and 3D representations
of a dataset, e.g. to identify structural or chemical motifs.
This can be used as a stand-alone feature builder, or combined with
the [chemiscope viewer](https://chemiscope.org) to generate an 
interactive visualization. 

```python
import ase.io
import chemiscope
from pet_mad.explore import PETMADFeaturizer

featurizer = PETMADFeaturizer(version="latest")

# Load structures
frames = ase.io.read("dataset.xyz", ":")

# You can just compute features
features = featurizer(frames, None)

# Or create an interactive visualization in a Jupyter notebook
chemiscope.explore(
    frames,
    featurize=featurizer
)
```

## Examples

More examples for **ASE, i-PI, and LAMMPS** are available in the [Atomistic
Cookbook](https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/pet-mad/pet-mad.html).

## Fine-tuning

PET-MAD can be fine-tuned using the
[Metatrain](https://metatensor.github.io/metatrain/latest/advanced-concepts/fine-tuning.html)
library.
