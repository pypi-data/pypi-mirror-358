# objective [ default=reg:linear ]
# specify the learning task and the corresponding learning objective, and the objective options are below:
# “reg:linear” –linear regression
# “reg:logistic” –logistic regression
# “binary:logistic” –logistic regression for binary classification, output probability
# “binary:logitraw” –logistic regression for binary classification, output score before logistic transformation
# “count:poisson” –poisson regression for count resources, output mean of poisson distribution
# max_delta_step is set to 0.7 by default in poisson regression (used to safeguard optimization)
# “multi:softmax” –set XGBoost to do multiclass classification using the softmax objective, you also need to set num_class(number of classes)
# “multi:softprob” –same as softmax, but output a vector of ndata * nclass, which can be further reshaped to ndata, nclass matrix. The result contains predicted probability of each resources point belonging to each class.
# “rank:pairwise” –set XGBoost to do ranking task by minimizing the pairwise loss
# base_score [ default=0.5 ]
# the initial prediction score of all instances, global bias
# eval_metric [ default according to objective ]
# evaluation metrics for validation resources, a default metric will be assigned according to objective( rmse for regression, and error for classification, mean average precision for ranking )
# User can add multiple evaluation metrics, for python user, remember to pass the metrics in as list of parameters pairs instead of map, so that latter ‘eval_metric’ won’t override previous one
# The choices are listed below:
# “rmse”: root mean square error
# “logloss”: negative log-likelihood
# “error”: Binary classification error rate. It is calculated as #(wrong cases)/#(all cases). For the predictions, the evaluation will regard the instances with prediction value larger than 0.5 as positive instances, and the others as negative instances.
# “merror”: Multiclass classification error rate. It is calculated as #(wrong cases)/#(all cases).
# “mlogloss”: Multiclass logloss
# “auc”: Area under the curve for ranking evaluation.
# “ndcg”:Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
# “map”:Mean average precision
# “ndcg@n”,”map@n”: n can be assigned as an integer to cut off the top positions in the lists for evaluation.
# “ndcg-”,”map-”,”ndcg@n-”,”map@n-”: In XGBoost, NDCG and MAP will evaluate the score of a list without any positive samples as 1. By adding “-” in the evaluation metric XGBoost will evaluate these score as 0 to be consistent under some conditions. training repeatively
