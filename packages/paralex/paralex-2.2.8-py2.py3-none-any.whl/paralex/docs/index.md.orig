# Paralex: lexicons of morphological paradigms

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/paralex.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/paralex)

Paralex is a standard for morphological lexicons which document inflectional paradigms.

It strives to provide data which is [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18), 
so it can be used automatically,
[CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care), so it respects and empowers language 
communities, and [DeAR](principles.md) (our own set of principles),
so we can create a virtuous data ecosystem. It was inspired by the [
Cross-Linguistic Data Formats
(CLDF)](https://cldf.clld.org/) standard, and adheres to a similar philosophy and the same the design principles. We aim to keep the two standards compatible in order to facilitate inter-operability.

A **paralex** lexicon is a set of tables written as [comma separated value (csv) files](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2018/07/09/csv/).
It follows a relational model, tables are written in [long form](long-form.md), 
[metadata](metadata.md)
is written using the [frictionless standard](https://frictionlessdata.io/), and the 
tables respect [pre-defined conventions](standard.md). An [ontology](paralex_ontology.xml) is also provided to allow converting paralex lexicons into RDF [lemon/ontolex](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) lexicons.

The standard is meant for sharing and interfacing, but not necessarily for data input.
The expectation is for data creators to first input data through any convenient means,
then convert the result into the standardized structure for publishing and sharing.
