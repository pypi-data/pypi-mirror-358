showerpipe
==========

|DOI| |PyPI version| |Tests| |Documentation| |License| |Code style: black|

Provides a Pythonic data pipeline for showering and hadronisation
programs in HEP.

Currently wraps interface for Pythia 8, with plans for Herwig and
Ariadne in future releases.

Installation
------------

Using conda (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest solution is to just install via conda:

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c jacanchaplais showerpipe

Pythia will be included as a dependency, and all relevant paths and
environment variables will be properly set.

Using existing Pythia installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Pythia 8 is already installed on your system, and available in your
``PYTHONPATH``, you can just install this package via ``pip``.

It also requires the ``PYTHIA8DATA`` environment variable to be set.
This is the path to the ``xmldoc/`` directory under Pythiaâ€™s ``share``
directory. You can do something like this in your shell config:

.. code:: bash

   export PYTHIA8DATA=/home/$USER/pythia82xx/share/Pythia8/xmldoc

With everything set up properly, simply run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install showerpipe
