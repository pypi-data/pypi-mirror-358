# 🌀 FleetingViews — View Management & Navigation for Flet

FleetingViews is a lightweight and powerful view management system for [Flet](https://flet.dev) apps.  
It helps you structure your app around clean views, guards, transitions, and reactive state — inspired by the best practices of modern frontend frameworks.

Think of it as a **router + state manager + lifecycle engine** for Flet.

✅ Reactive observables (`define_observable`, `subscribe`)  
✅ Two-way data binding with controls (`bind_to_control`)  
✅ Dynamic view transitions with animations  
✅ Built-in fallback 404 view
